Tweet: Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!

Tweet: The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce?

Tweet: The Democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!

Tweet: Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change

Tweet: Hillary's debate answer on delay: "That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We've had free --

Tweet: and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a -

Tweet: during a general election. I for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind --

Tweet: of position." Then separately she stated "He said something truly horrifying ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of --

Tweet: this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy." She then said "We have to accept the results and look to the future Donald --

Tweet: Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead." So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad

Tweet: In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally

Tweet: It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--

Tweet: states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!

Tweet: Serious voter fraud in Virginia New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!

Tweet: If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole I will terminate deal.

Tweet: The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!

Tweet: I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however since election they are worse!

Tweet: The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.

Tweet: The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House as it pertains to my business so complex - when actually it isn't!

Tweet: Thank you Alabama! From now on it’s going to be #AmericaFirst. Our goal is to bring back that wonderful phrase:…

Tweet: We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it!

Tweet: If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing they would be scorned &amp; called terrible names!

Tweet: Today there were terror attacks in Turkey Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!

Tweet: We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).

Tweet: especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states

Tweet: Yes it is true - Carlos Slim the great businessman from Mexico called me about getting together for a meeting. We met HE IS A GREAT GUY!

Tweet: Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult &amp; sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!

Tweet: I would have done even better in the election if that is possible if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently

Tweet: I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!

Tweet: I met some really great Air Force GENERALS and Navy ADMIRALS today talking about airplane capability and pricing. Very impressive people!

Tweet: The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed....cont:

Tweet: Someone incorrectly stated that the phrase "DRAIN THE SWAMP" was no longer being used by me. Actually we will always be trying to DTS.

Tweet: The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes

Tweet: Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35 I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!

Tweet: my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids has raised millions of dollars for them and now must stop. Wrong answer!

Tweet: As to the U.N. things will be different after Jan. 20th.

Tweet: slaughter you. This is a purely religious threat which turned into reality. Such hatred! When will the U.S. and all countries fight back?

Tweet: Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: "In my opinion it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity." So true!

Tweet: .@NBCNews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute: "until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes." Dishonest!

Tweet: The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace.Too bad but we will get it done anyway!

Tweet: President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving ISIS OCare etc.

Tweet: The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together talk and have a good time. So sad!

Tweet: The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!

Tweet: I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation raised or recieved millions more ALL of which is given to charity and media won't report!

Tweet: The DJT Foundation unlike most foundations never paid fees rent salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!

Tweet: President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states and lost.The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7 THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS! Thanks Donald!

Tweet: I thought and felt I would win big easily over the fabled 270 (306). When they cancelled fireworks they knew and so did I.

Tweet: North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!

Tweet: China has been taking out massive amounts of money &amp; wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade but won't help with North Korea. Nice!

Tweet: General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!

Tweet: People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work and it is not affordable - 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it "CRAZY"

Tweet: The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said "The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!" - And it is lousy healthcare.

Tweet: With all that Congress has to work on do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog as unfair as it

Tweet: Instead of driving jobs and wealth away AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION &amp; JOB

Tweet: There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.

Tweet: Trump is already delivering the jobs he promised America

Tweet: I will be having a general news conference on JANUARY ELEVENTH in N.Y.C. Thank you.

Tweet: The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!

Tweet: Julian Assange said "a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!

Tweet: Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This is just the beginning - much more to follow

Tweet: things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H). A total double standard! Media as usual gave them a pass.

Tweet: massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful!

Tweet: Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance.Some people just don't understand the "Movement"

Tweet: to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against "Intelligence" when in fact I am a big fan!

Tweet: Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja Mexico to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.

Tweet: How did NBC get "an exclusive look into the top secret report he (Obama) was presented?" Who gave them this report and why? Politics!

Tweet: So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?

Tweet: The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed) will be paid back by Mexico later!

Tweet: and knew they were in big trouble - which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minute.THEY SAW A MOVEMENT LIKE NEVER BEFORE

Tweet: Hopefully all supporters and those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN will go to D.C. on January 20th. It will be a GREAT SHOW!

Tweet: being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares he supported Kasich &amp; Hillary

Tweet: I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.

Tweet: Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe!

Tweet: Happy Birthday

Tweet: Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense!

Tweet: Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!

Tweet: Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!

Tweet: both countries will perhaps work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!

Tweet: Congratulation to Jane Timken on her major upset victory in becoming the Ohio Republican Party Chair. Jane is a loyal Trump supporter &amp; star

Tweet: I look very much forward to meeting Prime Minister Theresa May in Washington in the Spring. Britain a longtime U.S. ally is very special!

Tweet: Kellyanne Conway went to @MeetThePress this morning for an interview with @chucktodd. Dishonest media cut out 9 of her 10 minutes. Terrible!

Tweet: Before I or anyone saw the classified and/or highly confidential hacking intelligence report it was leaked out to @NBCNews. So serious!

Tweet: Dishonest media says Mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly. Media is fake!

Tweet: Rupert Murdoch is a great guy who likes me much better as a very successful candidate than he ever did as a very successful developer!

Tweet: groveling when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!

Tweet: Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford &amp; Fiat C!

Tweet: Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums &amp; deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor keep your plan?

Tweet: Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling why no action? Focus on them not T!

Tweet: Obama Administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?

Tweet: I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!

Tweet: I am on @foxandfriends - Enjoy!

Tweet: The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!

Tweet: Republican Senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash &amp; burn!

Tweet: Very grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE!

Tweet: From @FoxNews "Bombshell: In 2016 Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election." Check out his statement - Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Wow CNN had to retract big story on "Russia" with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: So they caught Fake News CNN cold but what about NBC CBS &amp; ABC? What about the failing @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!

Tweet: We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal terrific &amp; worked really hard. We will return!

Tweet: As I have always said let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!

Tweet: With only a very small majority the Republicans in the House &amp; Senate need more victories next year since Dems totally obstruct no votes!

Tweet: The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!

Tweet: Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is "sick." All G 20 leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!

Tweet: I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America!

Tweet: As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold Democrats and Russians!

Tweet: It's very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President.

Tweet: It's hard to read the Failing New York Times or the Amazon Washington Post because every story/opinion even if should be positive is bad!

Tweet: If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!

Tweet: Sen. Jeff Flake(y) who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite President. He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is “toast.”

Tweet: Shoplifting is a very big deal in China as it should be (5-10 years in jail) but not to father LaVar. Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful!

Tweet: The House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump. Big stuff. Deep State. Give this information NOW! @FoxNews

Tweet: The only people who don’t like the Tax Cut Bill are the people that don’t understand it or the Obstructionist Democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the Republicans!

Tweet: Funny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years!

Tweet: The Failing @nytimes the pipe organ for the Democrat Party has become a virtual lobbyist for them with regard to our massive Tax Cut Bill. They are wrong so often that now I know we have a winner!

Tweet: The Failing @nytimes has totally gone against the Social Media Guidelines that they installed to preserve some credibility after many of their biased reporters went Rogue! @foxandfriends

Tweet: The Chinese Envoy who just returned from North Korea seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people and the military put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch.

Tweet: Stock Market hits new Record High. Confidence and enthusiasm abound. More great numbers coming out!

Tweet: The Dow just broke 24000 for the first time (another all-time Record). If the Dems had won the Presidential Election the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence which is also at an all-time high would be “low and glum!”

Tweet: Thank you @SenOrrinHatch. Let’s continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Our FIFTH 1K milestone of 2017!#DOW24K #MAGA

Tweet: Today is a day that I’ve been looking very much forward to ALL YEAR LONG. It is one that you have heard me speak about many times before. Now as President of the United States it is my tremendous honor to finally wish America and the world a very MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Tweet: A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.

Tweet: The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!

Tweet: The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections.

Tweet: Republicans Senators are working hard to pass the biggest Tax Cuts in the history of our Country. The Bill is getting better and better. This is a once in a generation chance. Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!

Tweet: The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon - FAKE NEWS! He’s not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected

Tweet: Economists on the TAX CUTS and JOBS ACT:“The enactment of a comprehensive overhaul - complete with a lower corporate tax rate - will IGNITE our ECONOMY with levels of GROWTH not SEEN IN GENERATIONS...”

Tweet: We are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America. Special thanks to @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Chairman @SenOrrinHatch for shepherding our bill through the Senate. Look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas!

Tweet: Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate. Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage. Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment!

Tweet: I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!

Tweet: Great job First Lady Melania!

Tweet: So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while Crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system or just a double standard?

Tweet: Many people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress deleted and “acid washed” 33000 Emails? No justice!

Tweet: Congratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia Russia Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and “papers” should do the same with their Fake News!

Tweet: I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!

Tweet: Such a total miscarriage of Justice in San Francisco!

Tweet: Tainted (no very dishonest?) FBI “agent’s role in Clinton probe under review.” Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.

Tweet: After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more) running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not we will bring it back to greatness.

Tweet: People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of @ABC News (he has been suspended) should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!

Tweet: Report: “ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE” Now it all starts to make sense!

Tweet: Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration Border Wall Military Pro Life V.A. Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!

Tweet: Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes tough on crime strong on military and borders...&amp; so much more. Look at your 401-k’s since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back!

Tweet: With the great vote on Cutting Taxes this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOU!

Tweet: Today the U.S. flag flies at half-staff at the @WhiteHouse in honor of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.

Tweet: I fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn’t!

Tweet: Big crowd expected today in Pensacola Florida for a Make America Great Again speech. We have done so much in so short a period of time...and yet are planning to do so much more! See you there!

Tweet: LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He’s bad on Crime Life Border Vets Guns &amp; Military. VOTE ROY MOORE!

Tweet: Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped as has incorrectly been reported but will be pursued and if anything substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!

Tweet: A big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night. We can’t have a Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat Jones in that important Alabama Senate seat. Need your vote to Make America Great Again! Jones will always vote against what we must do for our Country.

Tweet: Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”). Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible or was it just gross incompetence?

Tweet: CNN’S slogan is CNN THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true that this could in fact be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!

Tweet: Heading to the great state of Mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected Governor @PhilBryantMS. Look forward to seeing the new Civil Rights Museum!

Tweet: .@daveweigel of the Washington Post just admitted that his picture was a FAKE (fraud?) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when in fact he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on T.V.). FAKE NEWS he should be fired.

Tweet: No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country. Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans – not for criminal aliens!

Tweet: Things are going really well for our economy a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing! Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA. Really good news and much more to come!

Tweet: Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important but SPECIAL!

Tweet: Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!

Tweet: Another false story this time in the Failing @nytimes that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong! Also I seldom if ever watch CNN or MSNBC both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon who I once called the “dumbest man on television!” Bad Reporting.

Tweet: Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don’t know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them) is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill &amp; Crooked-USED!

Tweet: The people of Alabama will do the right thing. Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion weak on Crime Military and Illegal Immigration Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL. Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet. Roy Moore will always vote with us. VOTE ROY MOORE!

Tweet: Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High along with a Record High Stock Market. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good).

Tweet: Wishing all of those celebrating #Hanukkah around the world a happy and healthy eight nights in the company of those they love.

Tweet: Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends!

Tweet: The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily) is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election. I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!

Tweet: Wow more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. Hence my use of Social Media the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriends

Tweet: Ivanka Trump will be interviewed on @foxandfriends.

Tweet: The train accident that just occurred in DuPont WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads bridges tunnels railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!

Tweet: A story in the @washingtonpost that I was close to “rescinding” the nomination of Justice Gorsuch prior to confirmation is FAKE NEWS. I never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The unnamed sources don’t exist!

Tweet: Congratulations to Paul Ryan Kevin McCarthy Kevin Brady Steve Scalise Cathy McMorris Rodgers and all great House Republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes!

Tweet: The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill. Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed. Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote. If approved there will be a News Conference at The White House at approximately 1:00 P.M.

Tweet: The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful and yet the Fake News is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends the defeated Dems and only demean. This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves starting very soon. Jobs Jobs Jobs!

Tweet: I would like to congratulate @SenateMajLdr on having done a fantastic job both strategically &amp; politically on the passing in the Senate of the MASSIVE TAX CUT &amp; Reform Bill. I could have not asked for a better or more talented partner. Our team will go onto many more VICTORIES!

Tweet: Home Sales hit BEST numbers in 10 years! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN

Tweet: THANK YOU to everyone who joined me at the @WhiteHouse yesterday. Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Our big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of “love” - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses. This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of and now it is the rage. Merry Christmas!

Tweet: So true!

Tweet: At some point and for the good of the country I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion. Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start. After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East it is time to start rebuilding our country!

Tweet: “The President has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year.” Thank you Charlie Kirk of Turning Points USA. Sadly the Fake Mainstream Media will NEVER talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews. We are compiling a long &amp; beautiful list.

Tweet: Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office. Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to sign the largest TAX CUTS and reform in the history of our country. Full remarks:

Tweet: Remember the most hated part of ObamaCare is the Individual Mandate which is being terminated under our just signed Tax Cut Bill.

Tweet: How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe the man in charge along with leakin’ James Comey of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?

Tweet: FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!

Tweet: Wow “FBI lawyer James Baker reassigned” according to @FoxNews.

Tweet: The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!

Tweet: Remember the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year. In Senate I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost. Virginia candidate was not a “Trumper” and he lost. Good Republican candidates will win BIG!

Tweet: .@FoxNews-FBI’s Andrew McCabe “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet) he was using allegedly his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.”

Tweet: The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: The Tax Cut/Reform Bill including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise...and our insider Polls are strong!

Tweet: Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare the Democrats &amp; Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan!

Tweet: WOW @foxandfrlends “Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.” And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!

Tweet: All signs are that business is looking really good for next year only to be helped further by our Tax Cut Bill. Will be a great year for Companies and JOBS! Stock Market is poised for another year of SUCCESS!

Tweet: Retail sales are at record numbers. We’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven’t seen anything yet!

Tweet: Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: In the East it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country but not other countries was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!

Tweet: While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec. 28 2017 was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28 2009 which was 47%...and this despite massive negative Trump coverage &amp; Russia hoax!

Tweet: Why is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!

Tweet: The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration &amp; ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!

Tweet: Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption &amp; its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad. Iranian govt should respect their people’s rights including right to express themselves. The world is watching! #IranProtests

Tweet: Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching!

Tweet: On Taxes: “This is the biggest corporate rate cut ever going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago.This is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy. Every year the Obama WH overstated how the economy would grow. Now real economics and jobs.” @WSJ Report

Tweet: I use Social Media not because I like to but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair “press” now often referred to as Fake News Media. Phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever. Many stories &amp; reports a pure fiction!

Tweet: Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U.S. Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut and it will only get better. MUCH MORE TO COME!

Tweet: “Trump Rally: Stocks put 2017 in the record books”

Tweet: Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!

Tweet: If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day. Now they have a great future - and just beginning!

Tweet: Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election. People are much better off now not to mention ISIS VA Judges Strong Border 2nd A Tax Cuts &amp; more?

Tweet: My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff and their families. We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all! #LESM

Tweet: What a year it’s been and we're just getting started. Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Happy New Year!!

Tweet: Iran the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!

Tweet: HAPPY NEW YEAR! We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and much faster than anyone thought possible!

Tweet: The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing but lies &amp; deceit thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan with little help. No more!

Tweet: Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food &amp; for freedom. Along with human rights the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!

Tweet: Will be leaving Florida for Washington (D.C.) today at 4:00 P.M. Much work to be done but it will be a great New Year!

Tweet: The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their “pockets.” The people have little food big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!

Tweet: Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid Huma Abedin has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey &amp; others

Tweet: Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for your kind words on how well we are doing at the Border. We will be bringing in more &amp; more of your great folks and will build the desperately needed WALL! @foxandfriends

Tweet: Companies are giving big bonuses to their workers because of the Tax Cut Bill. Really great!

Tweet: Sanctions and “other” pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea. Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea. Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. Perhaps that is good news perhaps not - we will see!

Tweet: Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017 the best and safest year on record!

Tweet: Democrats are doing nothing for DACA - just interested in politics. DACA activists and Hispanics will go hard against Dems will start “falling in love” with Republicans and their President! We are about RESULTS.

Tweet: We will not rest until all of America’s GREAT VETERANS can receive the care they so richly deserve. Tremendous progress has been made in a short period of time. Keep up the great work @SecShulkin @DeptVetAffairs!

Tweet: Congratulations to Senator Orrin Hatch on an absolutely incredible career. He has been a tremendous supporter and I will never forget the (beyond kind) statements he has made about me as President. He is my friend and he will be greatly missed in the U.S. Senate!

Tweet: North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his and my Button works!

Tweet: I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST &amp; CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock. Subjects will cover Dishonesty &amp; Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned!

Tweet: “Some 40 U.S. companies have responded to President Trump’s tax cut and reform victory in Congress last year by handing out bonuses up to $2000 increases in 401k matches and spending on charity a much higher number than previously known.”

Tweet: Stock Market had another good day but now that the Tax Cut Bill has passed we have tremendous upward potential. Dow just short of 25000 a number that few thought would be possible this soon into my administration. Also unemployment went down to 4.1%. Only getting better!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged must go to Voter I.D.

Tweet: As Americans you need identification sometimes in a very strong and accurate form for almost everything you do.....except when it comes to the most important thing VOTING for the people that run your country. Push hard for Voter Identification!

Tweet: With all of the failed “experts” weighing in does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm strong and willing to commit our total “might” against the North. Fools but talks are a good thing!

Tweet: So beautiful....Show this picture to the NFL players who still kneel!

Tweet: Dow just crashes through 25000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.

Tweet: Thank you to the great Republican Senators who showed up to our mtg on immigration reform. We must BUILD THE WALL stop illegal immigration end chain migration &amp; cancel the visa lottery. The current system is unsafe &amp; unfair to the great people of our country - time for change!

Tweet: MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!

Tweet: The Fake News Media barely mentions the fact that the Stock Market just hit another New Record and that business in the U.S. is booming...but the people know! Can you imagine if “O” was president and had these numbers - would be biggest story on earth! Dow now over 25000.

Tweet: Dow goes from 18589 on November 9 2016 to 25075 today for a new all-time Record. Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks Record fastest 1000 point move in history. This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda! Jobs Jobs Jobs. Six trillion dollars in value created!

Tweet: Well now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!

Tweet: The Mercer Family recently dumped the leaker known as Sloppy Steve Bannon. Smart!

Tweet: Good idea Rand!

Tweet: Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book. He used Sloppy Steve Bannon who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!

Tweet: The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8% the lowest rate in 45 years. I am so happy about this News! And in the Washington Post (of all places) headline states “Trumps first year jobs numbers were very very good.”

Tweet: Brian Ross the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the Stock Market down 350 points (billions of dollars) was suspended for a month but is now back at ABC NEWS in a lower capacity. He is no longer allowed to report on Trump. Should have been fired!

Tweet: Leaving Camp David for the White House. Great meetings with the Cabinet and Military on many very important subjects including Border Security &amp; the desperately needed Wall the ever increasing Drug and Opioid Problem Infrastructure Military Budget Trade and DACA.

Tweet: I’ve had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President. Now I have to put up with a Fake Book written by a totally discredited author. Ronald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well. So will I!

Tweet: Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration. Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!

Tweet: The Fake News Awards those going to the most corrupt &amp; biased of the Mainstream Media will be presented to the losers on Wednesday January 17th rather than this coming Monday. The interest in and importance of these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated!

Tweet: The Stock Market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only Record Setting Stock Prices but present and future Jobs Jobs Jobs. Seven TRILLION dollars of value created since our big election win!

Tweet: African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote! #NeverForget @foxandfriends

Tweet: Can’t wait to be back in the amazing state of Tennessee to address the 99th American @FarmBureau Federation’s Annual Convention in Nashville! #AFBF18On my way now - join me LIVE at 4:00pmE:

Tweet: We have been working every day to DELIVER for America’s Farmers just as they work every day to deliver FOR US. #AFBF18

Tweet: In every decision we make we are honoring America’s PROUD FARMING LEGACY. Years of crushing taxes crippling regs &amp; corrupt politics left our communities hurting our economy stagnant &amp; millions of hardworking Americans COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN. But they are not forgotten ANYMORE!

Tweet: We are fighting for our farmers for our country and for our GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. We want our flag respected - and we want our NATIONAL ANTHEM respected also!

Tweet: On behalf of the American people THANK YOU to our incredible law enforcement officers. As President of the United States - I will fight for you and I will never ever let you down. Now more than ever we must support the men and women in blue! #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay

Tweet: It was my great honor to sign H.R. 267 the “Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park Act” which redesignates the Martin Luther King Junior National Historic Site in the State of Georgia as the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park.

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to sign a new Executive Order to ensure Veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life. We must ensure that our HEROES are given the care and support they so richly deserve!

Tweet: Thank you @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy! Couldn’t agree w/you more. TOGETHER we are #MAGA🇺🇸

Tweet: .@ICEgov HSI agents and ERO officers on behalf of an entire Nation THANK YOU for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow American’s SAFE. Everyone is so grateful!#LawEnforcementAppreciationDayPresident @realDonaldTrump

Tweet: It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.

Tweet: The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!

Tweet: The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion &amp; yet on and on it goes. Russia &amp; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!

Tweet: I want to thank my @Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country. 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead. Together we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the @WhiteHouse - a great friend and ally of the United States! Joint press conference:

Tweet: Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest! Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4000 JOBS and investing $1.6 BILLION in Alabama helping to further grow our economy!

Tweet: Good news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville Alabama plant which will produce over 300000 cars and SUV’s a year and employ 4000 people. Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way. Congratulations Alabama!

Tweet: Disproven and paid for by Democrats “Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election?” @foxandfriends Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails? What a mess!

Tweet: In new Quinnipiac Poll 66% of people feel the economy is “Excellent or Good.” That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.

Tweet: “House votes on controversial FISA ACT today.” This is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?

Tweet: “45 year low in illegal immigration this year.” @foxandfriends

Tweet: With that being said I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!

Tweet: Great news as a result of our TAX CUTS &amp; JOBS ACT!

Tweet: Yesterday I signed the #INTERDICTAct (H.R. 2142) with bipartisan members of Congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country. Together we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the United States!

Tweet: Thank you Adam Levine The Federalist in interview on @foxandfriends “Donald Trump is the greatest President our Country has ever seen.”

Tweet: Small Business Poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history. All business is just at the beginning of something really special!

Tweet: More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform: Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 BILLION in Michigan plant relocating their heavy-truck production from Mexico to Michigan adding 2500 new jobs and paying $2000 bonus to U.S. employees!

Tweet: Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan reversing a years long opposite trend. Thank you Chrysler a very wise decision. The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence. Plenty of more to follow!

Tweet: Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!

Tweet: The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery &amp; Chain. USA!

Tweet: Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!

Tweet: The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!

Tweet: Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA. Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST!

Tweet: Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country. Never said “take them out.” Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately no trust!

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to proclaim January 15 2018 as Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic community and service activities in honor of Dr. King's life and legacy.

Tweet: Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again!

Tweet: The Democrats are all talk and no action. They are doing nothing to fix DACA. Great opportunity missed. Too bad!

Tweet: AMERICA FIRST!

Tweet: Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market. Chrysler coming back to U.S. (Michigan) from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees. If Dems won in November Market would have TANKED! It was headed for disaster.

Tweet: I don’t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!

Tweet: So much Fake News is being reported. They don’t even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election!

Tweet: DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.

Tweet: I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST

Tweet: Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can’t get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military.

Tweet: We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!

Tweet: The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery.

Tweet: Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems. Public gets it!

Tweet: “90% of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative” -and much of it contrived!@foxandfriends

Tweet: Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded. Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled. Thank you and it will get even (much) better! @FoxNews

Tweet: Eric Trump on @foxandfriends now!

Tweet: Today we witnessed an incredible moment in history – the presentation of Congress’ highest civilian honor to our friend and true AMERICAN HERO Bob Dole. #CongressionalGoldMedal

Tweet: I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States. Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA!

Tweet: During the campaign I promised to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country. I am very proud to see companies like Chrysler moving operations from Mexico to Michigan where there are so many great American workers!

Tweet: Main Street is BACK! Strongest Holiday Sales bump since the Great Recession -- beating forecasts by BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

Tweet: Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13). Rick is a great guy. We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda!

Tweet: We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall there is no Deal!

Tweet: CHIP should be part of a long term solution not a 30 Day or short term extension!

Tweet: A government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the Dems care very little about!

Tweet: Departing Pittsburgh now where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers and to show the world that AMERICA is back - and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before!

Tweet: AMERICA will once again be a NATION that thinks big dreams bigger and always reaches for the stars. YOU are the ones who will shape America’s destiny. YOU are the ones who will restore our prosperity. And YOU are the ones who are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #MAGA

Tweet: House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight. So important for our country - our Military needs it!

Tweet: Government Funding Bill past last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!

Tweet: .@WhiteHouse Briefing with Director Marc Short and Director Mick

Tweet: “Shutting down the government is a very serious thing. People die accidents happen. I don’t know how I would vote right now on a CR OK?”Sen. Dianne Feinstein

Tweet: Today I was honored and proud to address the 45th Annual @March_for_Life! You are living witnesses of this year’s March for Life theme: #LoveSavesLives.

Tweet: Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election. I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!

Tweet: Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with @SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan. Making progress - four week extension would be best!

Tweet: Not looking good for our great Military or Safety &amp; Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy.

Tweet: Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!

Tweet: This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown

Tweet: For those asking the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on Crime (and Border) and even better to our Military &amp; Veterans!

Tweet: #AMERICA FIRST!

Tweet: Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can’t let that happen!

Tweet: Beautiful weather all over our great country a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!

Tweet: Unprecedented success for our Country in so many ways since the Election. Record Stock Market Strong on Military Crime Borders &amp; ISIS Judicial Strength &amp; Numbers Lowest Unemployment for Women &amp; ALL Massive Tax Cuts end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018!

Tweet: The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation in just twelve months than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office no matter what the length. The good news is THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME!

Tweet: Eric Trump on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews now!

Tweet: Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real long term budget no C.R.’s!

Tweet: Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an “A”-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements. Working hard!

Tweet: The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good!

Tweet: Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don’t want to do it but are powerless!

Tweet: End the Democrats Obstruction!

Tweet: Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone including Republicans Democrats and DACA but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table!

Tweet: Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: “Trump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost.” Thank you for your honesty Jim!

Tweet: In one of the biggest stories in a long time the FBI says it is now missing five months worth of lovers Strzok - Page texts perhaps 50000 all in prime time. Wow!

Tweet: In one of the biggest stories in a long time the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts perhaps 50000 and all in prime time. Wow!

Tweet: Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans &amp; Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8 but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!

Tweet: Thank you to General John Kelly who is doing a fantastic job and all of the Staff and others in the White House for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult but it is always great to WIN and few have won more than us!

Tweet: Where are the 50000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok? Blaming Samsung!

Tweet: Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fully understands especially after his humiliating defeat that if there is no Wall there is no DACA. We must have safety and security together with a strong Military for our great people!

Tweet: Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. Now Disney J.P. Morgan Chase and many others. Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs Jobs Jobs!

Tweet: DACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryin’ Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration!

Tweet: Thank you for the wonderful welcome @WEF! #Davos2018

Tweet: Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly NEED THE WALL. Must also end loophole of “catch &amp; release” and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border NOW for Safety &amp; Security reasons.

Tweet: I have offered DACA a wonderful deal including a doubling in the number of recipients &amp; a twelve year pathway to citizenship for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA only use it!

Tweet: Democrats are not interested in Border Safety &amp; Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction!

Tweet: Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!

Tweet: Our economy is better than it has been in many decades. Businesses are coming back to America like never before. Chrysler as an example is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA. Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on the right track!

Tweet: March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist Blame Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix NOW!

Tweet: Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network for the first time ever with 11.7 million people tuning in. Delivered from the heart!

Tweet: The Democrats just aren’t calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast or they’ll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up fast.

Tweet: The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank &amp; File are great people!

Tweet: Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49% a far better number than I had in winning the Election and higher than certain “sacred cows.” Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well someday!

Tweet: This memo totally vindicates “Trump” in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!

Tweet: Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion!

Tweet: My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina. Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they’ve done!

Tweet: Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a great Super Bowl victory!

Tweet: The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!

Tweet: Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that’s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!

Tweet: Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!

Tweet: Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!

Tweet: Representative Devin Nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!

Tweet: Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law your paychecks are going way UP your taxes are going way DOWN and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS!

Tweet: So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border and with illegal immigration FAST!

Tweet: My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @Colts

Tweet: Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA fully secures the border ends chain migration &amp; cancels the visa lottery. If D’s oppose this deal they aren’t serious about DACA-they just want open borders.

Tweet: We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system. Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security.

Tweet: Today we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS-13 and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it. Watch here:

Tweet: Congratulations to the Republic of Korea on what will be a MAGNIFICENT Winter Olympics! What the South Korean people have built is truly an inspiration!

Tweet: The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military. It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill!

Tweet: Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Great religious and political leaders and many friends including T.V. producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph will be there. Looking forward to seeing all!

Tweet: Our founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Our currency declares “IN GOD WE TRUST.” And we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance and proclaim that we are “One Nation Under God.” #NationalPrayerBreakfast

Tweet: I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1:45pm. Will be discussing North Korea China and the Middle East.

Tweet: As long as we open our eyes to God’s grace - and open our hearts to God’s love - then America will forever be the land of the free the home of the brave and a light unto all nations. #NationalPrayerBreakfast

Tweet: Time to end the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans.

Tweet: Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary.

Tweet: Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS!

Tweet: Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military. Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!

Tweet: Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately DACA not included in this Bill negotiations to start now!

Tweet: Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low!

Tweet: The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods (and more) would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!

Tweet: According to the @nytimes a Russian sold phony secrets on “Trump” to the U.S. Asking price was $10 million brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. I hope people are now seeing &amp; understanding what is going on here. It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP!

Tweet: Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?

Tweet: Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican!

Tweet: My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the @WestervillePD.

Tweet: My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans.

Tweet: So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn’t want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history! #MAGA

Tweet: 4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Bill....and it will only get better! We are far ahead of schedule.

Tweet: Rep. Lou Barletta a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong &amp; smart loves Pennsylvania &amp; loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts unlike Bob Casey who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer!

Tweet: Just spoke to @JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @WestervillePD. This is a true tragedy!

Tweet: This will be a big week for Infrastructure. After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East it is now time to start investing in OUR Country!

Tweet: Thank you to Sue Kruczek who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge for your kind words while on @foxandfriends. We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - Nick will not have died in vain!

Tweet: The journey to #MAGA began @CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year. See you at #CPAC2018!

Tweet: Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more. Bipartisan make deal Dems?

Tweet: Negotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn’t it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity! March 5th.

Tweet: As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all. Proclamation:

Tweet: Today I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America’s depleted infrastructure.

Tweet: My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.

Tweet: Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.

Tweet: So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again!

Tweet: While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!

Tweet: In times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need.

Tweet: Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland Florida:

Tweet: I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. Am also working with Congress on many fronts.

Tweet: Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard.

Tweet: Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014 long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!

Tweet: Our entire Nation w/one heavy heart continues to pray for the victims &amp; their families in Parkland FL. To teachers law enforcement first responders &amp; medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We THANK YOU for your courage!

Tweet: Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida. Will never forget them or the evening!

Tweet: “Charges Deal Don A Big Win” written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost succinctly states that “the Russians had no impact on the election results.” There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. “She lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.”

Tweet: Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: “There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.

Tweet: Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know!

Tweet: The Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads Rob Goldman!

Tweet: “I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.”Rob GoldmanVice President of Facebook Ads

Tweet: Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp; Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to and now they just talk!

Tweet: Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!

Tweet: General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company!

Tweet: Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!

Tweet: Finally Liddle’ Adam Schiff the leakin’ monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing. Thank you Adam!

Tweet: I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said “it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!

Tweet: Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. But wasn’t I a great candidate?

Tweet: If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the U.S. then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!

Tweet: The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN.

Tweet: Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Big gain over last 4 weeks. I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away. We need more Republicans!

Tweet: Thank you to KenStarr former Independent Counsel Whitewater for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse Russian meddling etc. Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo

Tweet: My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today The Daytona 500. Brian France and the France family are special people. Enjoy the race!

Tweet: Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey who at one point I knew very well interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!

Tweet: Have a great but very reflective President’s Day!

Tweet: Obama was President up to and beyond the 2016 Election. So why didn’t he do something about Russian meddling?

Tweet: .@MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah. He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch and has my full support and endorsement!

Tweet: The U.S. economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations &amp; Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS JOBS JOBS

Tweet: “The Faith of Donald Trump” a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb is a very interesting read. Enjoy!

Tweet: Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!

Tweet: Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially. Also they want to do nothing on DACA R’s want to fix!

Tweet: Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event. Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House. You’ve come a long way Matt!

Tweet: Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don’t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp; waste money!

Tweet: I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama just look at the facts. Total Fake News!

Tweet: Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law. "This shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses."

Tweet: Bad ratings @CNN &amp; @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise!

Tweet: So true thank you!

Tweet: @CNN @MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!

Tweet: Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Session!

Tweet: The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.

Tweet: Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!

Tweet: Yesterday it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers the Medal of Valor. #AmericanHeroes

Tweet: .@FLOTUS Melania and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of Billy Graham. Our prayers are with his children grandchildren great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with Reverend Graham in his lifelong ministry.

Tweet: I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students teachers and families. So much love in the midst of so much pain. We must not let them down. We must keep our children safe!!Full Listening Session:

Tweet: I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN &amp; @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers a lot would now be able to

Tweet: I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!

Tweet: What many people don’t understand or don’t want to understand is that Wayne Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 11:30 A.M. to discuss School Safety. Next week it will be with our Nation’s Governors. It’s been many years of all talk no action. We’ll get it done!

Tweet: On behalf of an entire Nation CONGRATULATIONS to the U.S. Women's Hockey Team on winning the GOLD! #GoTeamUSA #Olympics

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the @WhiteHouse with State and local leaders law enforcement officers and education officials.There is nothing more important than protecting our children. They deserve to be safe and we will deliver!

Tweet: “School shooting survivor says he quit @CNN Town Hall after refusing scripted question.” @TuckerCarlson. Just like so much of CNN Fake News. That’s why their ratings are so bad! MSNBC may be worse.

Tweet: MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands but these killers come back in from El Salvador and through Mexico like water. El Salvador just takes our money and Mexico must help MORE with this problem. We need The Wall!

Tweet: CPAC Today!

Tweet: My daughter Ivanka just arrived in South Korea. We cannot have a better or smarter person representing our country.

Tweet: For those of you who are still interested the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA. Not a lot of interest on this subject from them!

Tweet: We salute our great American flag we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of Allegiance and we all PROUDLY STAND for the National Anthem. #CPAC2018

Tweet: Our nation’s motto is IN GOD WE TRUST. This week our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean. We will never forget the historic crowds the voice the energy and the profound faith of Billy Graham! #CPAC2018

Tweet: Today @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome Prime Minister @TurnbullMalcolm and Mrs. Turnbull of Australia to the @WhiteHouse!🇺🇸🇦🇺Press Conference:

Tweet: Thank you to the great men and women of the United States @SecretService for a job well done!

Tweet: So true Wayne and Lowest black unemployment in history!

Tweet: Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept &amp; have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again - a big &amp; very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States.

Tweet: Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania. @FoxNews. This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole. Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP!

Tweet: Unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973. Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations!

Tweet: Dems are no longer talking DACA! “Out of sight out of mind” they say. DACA beneficiaries should not be happy. Nancy Pelosi truly doesn’t care about them. Republicans stand ready to make a deal!

Tweet: BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS: 93% APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING (Thank you!). 50% say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME (funny!). 79% say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump (starting to happen).

Tweet: The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST. Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. SO ILLEGAL!

Tweet: Dem Memo: FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC. Wow!

Tweet: “Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump” @FoxNews Of course not because there is none and never was. This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace...and Obama did nothing about Russia!

Tweet: “Congressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts” @FoxNews So what else is new. He is a total phony!

Tweet: I will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews at 9:00 P.M. Enjoy!

Tweet: “He’s got a very good point. Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs. Clinton’s criminality at her own hands or through others that ought to be investigated. I fully agree with the President on that.” @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum Show

Tweet: “I’ve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year. I just don’t see the evidence....in terms of the collusion it’s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have.” Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews

Tweet: “We’ve seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION....I have seen nothing the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he’s exercising his power as the President of the U.S. I just don’t see it.” Judge Ken Starr

Tweet: WITCH HUNT!

Tweet: I want to encourage all of my many Texas friends to vote in the primary for Governor Greg Abbott Senator Ted Cruz Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton. They are helping me to Make America Great Again! Vote early or on March 6th.

Tweet: “American consumers are the most confident they've been since 2000....A strong job market is boosting confidence. The unemployment rate has stayed at a 17-year low.”

Tweet: Texas LC George P. Bush backed me when it wasn’t the politically correct thing to do and I back him now. Also AC Sid Miller has been with me from the beginning he is “Trump’s Man in Texas.” Also support Comptroller Glenn Hegar and Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick.

Tweet: .@SenatorWicker of Mississippi has been a great supporter and incredible help in getting our massive Tax Cut Bill done and approved. Also big help on cutting regs. I am with him in his re-election all the way!

Tweet: Such a beautiful map thank you!

Tweet: Big legal win today. U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward!

Tweet: The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64% of the Trump Agenda is already done faster than even Ronald Reagan. “We’re blown away” said Thomas Binion of Heritage President Trump “is very active very conservative and very effective. Huge volume &amp; spectrum of issues.”

Tweet: I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!

Tweet: 45 year low on illegal border crossings this year. Ice and Border Patrol Agents are doing a great job for our Country. MS-13 thugs being hit hard.

Tweet: Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!

Tweet: Today in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham – an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God’s grace.

Tweet: Today we honor Billy Graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored. We say a prayer for our country: that all across this land the Lord will raise up men and women like Billy Graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of God.

Tweet: It was an honor to welcome bipartisan members of Congress for a discussion on SAFE schools and SAFE communities. As we continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives in Parkland we are determined to turn our grief into action. Full meeting:

Tweet: Many ideas some good &amp; some not so good emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!

Tweet: Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free fair and SMART TRADE!

Tweet: Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!

Tweet: Alex Baldwin whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL now says playing DJT was agony for him. Alex it was also agony for those who were forced to watch. You were terrible. Bring back Darrell Hammond much funnier and a far greater talent!

Tweet: When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with trade wars are good and easy to win. Example when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!

Tweet: Alec Baldwin whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL now says playing me was agony. Alec it was agony for those who were forced to watch. Bring back Darrell Hammond funnier and a far greater talent!

Tweet: Eric we are all with you and your family! Look forward to seeing you back on T.V.

Tweet: We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY!

Tweet: When a country Taxes our products coming in at say 50% and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO not fair or smart. We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice!

Tweet: REST IN PEACE BILLY GRAHAM!

Tweet: Heading to Billy Graham Funeral. A Special Man!

Tweet: Happy National Anthem Day!

Tweet: Mainstream Media in U.S. is being mocked all over the world. They’ve gone CRAZY!

Tweet: The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our “very stupid” trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!

Tweet: If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!

Tweet: The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the American People!

Tweet: We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry it’s time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: To protect our Country we must protect American Steel! #AMERICA FIRST

Tweet: Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.

Tweet: It’s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA. Gave them 6 months they just don’t care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!

Tweet: The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come &amp; go and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos only great Energy!

Tweet: Total inaction on DACA by Dems. Where are you? A deal can be made!

Tweet: We are getting it done - jobs and security!

Tweet: We will see what happens!

Tweet: Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is we don’t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding of course)!

Tweet: Federal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that “President Trump has the right to end DACA.” President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem and didn’t. I am waiting for the Dems they are running for the hills!

Tweet: Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!

Tweet: Will be making a decision soon on the appointment of new Chief Economic Advisor. Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!

Tweet: Great couple great book!

Tweet: @MarkBurnettTV @RealRomaDowney From Bush 1 to present our Country has lost more than 55000 factories 6000000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad policies &amp; leadership. Must win again! #MAGA

Tweet: North Korea has not conducted a Missile Test since November 28 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. I believe they will honor that commitment!

Tweet: In the first hours after hearing that North Korea’s leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end the press was startled &amp; amazed.They couldn’t believe it. But by the following morning the news became FAKE.They said so what who cares!

Tweet: The European Union wonderful countries who treat the U.S. very badly on trade are complaining about the tariffs on Steel &amp; Aluminum. If they drop their horrific barriers &amp; tariffs on U.S. products going in we will likewise drop ours. Big Deficit. If not we Tax Cars etc. FAIR!

Tweet: Epic crowd in Moon Township Pennsylvania tonight. Thank you! Get out on Tuesday and VOTE for Rick @Saccone4PA18. Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday.

Tweet: The Democrats continue to Obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government...A record in U.S. history. State Department Ambassadors and many others are being slow walked. Senate must approve NOW!

Tweet: Rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50% which is higher than Obama and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are “somewhat low.” They know they are lying when they say it. Turn off the show - FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A. Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.

Tweet: If schools are mandated to be gun free zones violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!

Tweet: The Pittsburgh Post Gazette just endorsed Rick Saccone for Congress. He will be much better for steel and business. Very strong on experience and what our Country needs. Lamb will always vote for Pelosi and Dems....Will raise taxes weak on Crime and Border.

Tweet: It was my great honor to welcome the 2017 World Series Champion Houston @Astros to the @WhiteHouse! #HoustonStrong

Tweet: THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

Tweet: The Economy is raging at an all time high and is set to get even better. Jobs and wages up. Vote for Rick Saccone and keep it going!

Tweet: Mike Pompeo Director of the CIA will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!

Tweet: Heading to see the BORDER WALL prototypes in California!

Tweet: “According to the Center for Immigration Studies the $18 billion wall will pay for itself by curbing the importation of crime drugs and illegal immigrants who tend to go on the federal dole...”

Tweet: California’s sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. Thousands of dangerous &amp; violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies set free to prey on innocent Americans. THIS MUST STOP!

Tweet: If we don’t have a wall system we’re not going to have a country. Congress must fund the BORDER WALL &amp; prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country &amp; the people of our country. We must enforce our laws &amp; protect our people! #BuildTheWall

Tweet: It was my great honor to deliver a message at the Marine Core Air Station Miramar to our GREAT U.S. Military straight from the heart of the American People: We support you we thank you we love you - and we will always have your back!

Tweet: It was my great honor to deliver a message at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to our GREAT U.S. Military straight from the heart of the American People: We support you we thank you we love you - and we will always have your back!

Tweet: All across this nation we pray for our country and we THANK GOD for our United States Marines! Thank you. God Bless You. And God Bless America!

Tweet: Hundreds of good people including very important Ambassadors and Judges are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate. Many important positions in Government are unfilled because of this obstruction. Worst in U.S. history!

Tweet: Perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of U.S. companies been better than they are today!

Tweet: Five of our incredible @Cabinet Secretaries are testifying on the Hill this morning on the need to rebuild our Nation’s crumbling infrastructure. We need to build FAST &amp; we need to build for our FUTURE. Thank you @SenateCommerce for hosting this hearing! #InfrastructureInAmerica

Tweet: We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country!

Tweet: Thank you for hosting! #MAGA

Tweet: Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again!

Tweet: Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: It was wonderful to be back in Missouri where our push for historic TAX CUTS all began. Six months ago I promised that we would cut taxes to bring Main Street roaring back - and that is exactly what is happening!

Tweet: Please join me with your thoughts and prayers for both aviators their families and our incredible @USNavy.

Tweet: Larry Kudlow will be my Chief Economic Advisor as Director of the National Economic Council. Our Country will have many years of Great Economic &amp; Financial Success with low taxes unparalleled innovation fair trade and an ever expanding labor force leading the way! #MAGA

Tweet: We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada a very good guy doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating) but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know!

Tweet: It was my honor to welcome Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland to the @WhiteHouse!

Tweet: Continuing to monitor the heartbreaking bridge collapse at FIU - so tragic. Many brave First Responders rushed in to save lives. Thank you for your courage. Praying this evening for all who are affected.

Tweet: Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the Iraq-Syria border yesterday. Their sacrifice in service to our country will never be forgotten.

Tweet: It would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada and it’s unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller who is doing a really good job could run for Senate unopposed!

Tweet: “U.S. Consumer Confidence Hits 14-Year High”

Tweet: Andrew McCabe FIRED a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!

Tweet: Happy #StPatricksDay

Tweet: As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice &amp; State. #DrainTheSwamp

Tweet: The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all and much more!

Tweet: The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!

Tweet: Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked “have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?” He said strongly “never no.” He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.

Tweet: Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?

Tweet: Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats some big Crooked Hillary supporters and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet there is NO COLLUSION!

Tweet: .@seanhannity on @foxandfriends now! Great! 8:18 A.M.

Tweet: A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!

Tweet: The Democrats do not want to help DACA. Would be so easy to make a deal!

Tweet: Our Nation was founded by farmers. Our independence was won by farmers. And our continent was tamed by farmers. Our farmers always lead the way -- we are PROUD of them and we are DELIVERING for them! #NationalAgricultureDay

Tweet: AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD. Great job by law enforcement and all concerned!

Tweet: Department of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona. I agree with @LouDobbs. Should have sought review.

Tweet: Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military $716 Billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.

Tweet: Democrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy but they just didn’t care. I had to fight for Military and start of Wall.

Tweet: Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault. He doesn’t know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!

Tweet: Remember when they were saying during the campaign that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff. Well not saying that anymore!

Tweet: As a candidate I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade protect American workers and defend our national security. Today we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment.

Tweet: My honor Charlie - thank you! #MAGA

Tweet: I am pleased to announce that effective 4/9/18 @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job &amp; will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.

Tweet: House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign &amp; Russia. (2) The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.

Tweet: DACA was abandoned by the Democrats. Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.

Tweet: I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL which is desperately needed for our National Defense is not fully funded.

Tweet: News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill. 1:00 P.M.

Tweet: Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.

Tweet: As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill. I say to Congress: I will NEVER sign another bill like this again. To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills!

Tweet: Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in France yesterday and we grieve the nation’s loss. We also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support. We are with you @EmmanuelMacron!

Tweet: France honors a great hero. Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS related terror attack. So much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical Islamic terrorism. Even stronger measures needed especially at borders!

Tweet: Because of the $700 &amp; $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military many jobs are created and our Military is again rich. Building a great Border Wall with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M!

Tweet: Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!

Tweet: Happy National #MedalOfHonorDay to our HEROES. We love you!

Tweet: “President Donald J. Trump Proclaims March 25 2018 as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy”

Tweet: .@HowieCarrShow just wrote a book which everyone is talking about. He was a great help. He is a veteran journalist who had a great influence in NH and beyond. He calls it the most amazing political campaign of modern times. The book is called “What Really Happened.” Enjoy! #MAGA

Tweet: The economy is looking really good. It has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers. The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.

Tweet: So much Fake News. Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. But through it all our country is doing great!

Tweet: Great news! #MAGA

Tweet: Trade talks going on with numerous countries that for many years have not treated the United States fairly. In the end all will be happy!

Tweet: I am very pleased to welcome the opioid memorial to the President's Park in April. I encourage all to visit and remember those who we have lost to this deadly epidemic. We will keep fighting until we defeat the opioid crisis!

Tweet: THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED! As much as Democrats would like to see this happen and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens NO WAY. We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!

Tweet: For years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting!

Tweet: Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime and unfortunately maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost!

Tweet: .@USTradeRep just announced an agreement in principle with South Korea on KORUS! A great deal for American and Korean workers. Let’s now focus on our important security relationship.

Tweet: Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL!

Tweet: I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.) and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!

Tweet: We are going to REBUILD our crumbling infrastructure and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the Great State of Ohio. A tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site where the skills of the American Worker are forged and refined!

Tweet: JOBS JOBS JOBS! Unemployment claims have fallen to a 45-year low. Together we are making the economy great again!

Tweet: Washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing OUR OWN infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair. No more! It's time to REBUILD and we will do it with American WORKERS American GRIT and American PRIDE!

Tweet: Governor Jerry “Moonbeam” Brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) Kidnapping and Robbery (2) Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) Dealing drugs. Is this really what the great people of California want? @FoxNews

Tweet: HAPPY EASTER!

Tweet: Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch &amp; Release. Getting more dangerous. “Caravans” coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!

Tweet: Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA. NEED WALL!

Tweet: These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act!

Tweet: DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime!

Tweet: Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S. hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!

Tweet: So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke.

Tweet: Only fools or worse are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE and this will be changed. Also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!

Tweet: So sad that the Department of “Justice” and the FBI are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!

Tweet: An honor to host the Annual @WhiteHouse Easter Egg Roll!

Tweet: “President Donald J. Trump Proclaims April 2 2018 World Autism Awareness Day”

Tweet: As ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico &amp; Canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an Obama joke. ACT CONGRESS

Tweet: Honduras Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL. Democrats allow open borders drugs and crime!

Tweet: 39% of my nominations including Diplomats to foreign lands have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay. At this rate it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working. Never happened before. Disgraceful!

Tweet: “President Trump's approval rate among likely U.S. voters hit 50 percent on Monday which puts him higher than former President Barack Obama's score at the same point into his first term according to a new poll.” Via: @Anna_Giaritelli @DCExaminer

Tweet: #AutismAwarenessDay #LightItUpBlue

Tweet: The Fake News Networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast. The “Fakers” at CNN NBC ABC &amp; CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!

Tweet: The big Caravan of People from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!

Tweet: Check out the fact that you can’t get a job at ratings challenged @CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump? Little Jeff Zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately. They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting!

Tweet: Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling. Just hit 50% which is higher than Cheatin’ Obama at the same time in his Administration.

Tweet: I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don’t have a clue (or do they?)!

Tweet: Today it was my honor to welcome Estonia President @KerstiKaljulaid Lithuania President @Grybauskaite_LT and Latvia President @Vejonis to the @WhiteHouse. Congratulations on your 100th anniversaries of independence! #BalticSummit:

Tweet: WE WILL PROTECT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!

Tweet: Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube’s HQ in San Bruno California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.

Tweet: Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico &amp; Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era and other laws NOW! The Democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked....CRIME! We will be taking strong action today.

Tweet: We are not in a trade war with China that war was lost many years ago by the foolish or incompetent people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!

Tweet: When you’re already $500 Billion DOWN you can’t lose!

Tweet: Our thoughts and prayers are with the four U.S. Marines from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing who lost their lives in yesterday’s Southern California helicopter crash. We pray for their families and our great @USMC.

Tweet: Today we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the 50th anniversary of his assassination. Earlier this year I spoke about Dr. King’s legacy of justice and peace and his impact on uniting Americans. #MLK50 Proclamation:

Tweet: “Still Rising: Rasmussen Poll Shows Donald Trump Approval Ratings Now at 51 Percent”

Tweet: The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border. Because of the Trump Administrations actions Border crossings are at a still UNACCEPTABLE 46 year low. Stop drugs!

Tweet: The Fake News Washington Post Amazon’s “chief lobbyist” has another (of many) phony headlines “Trump Defiant As China Adds Trade Penalties.” WRONG! Should read “Trump Defiant as U.S. Adds Trade Penalties Will End Barriers And Massive I.P. Theft.” Typically bad reporting!

Tweet: Thanks to our historic TAX CUTS America is open for business and millions of American workers are seeing more take-home pay through higher wages salaries and bonuses!

Tweet: Thank you @WVGovernor Jim Justice. It was my great honor to be with the amazing people of West Virginia today! #MAGA

Tweet: Despite the Aluminum Tariffs Aluminum prices are DOWN 4%. People are surprised I’m not! Lots of money coming into U.S. coffers and Jobs Jobs Jobs!

Tweet: China which is a great economic power is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.

Tweet: Do you believe that the Fake News Media is pushing hard on a story that I am going to replace A.G. Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege? Do people really believe this stuff? So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!

Tweet: AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!

Tweet: “BET founder: Trump's economy is bringing black workers back into the labor force”

Tweet: Congratulations to @bernieandsid on their new @77wabcradio morning radio show in New York City. It was an honor to join you two – good luck!

Tweet: Just spoke to @JustinTrudeau to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible Humboldt Team tragedy. May God be with them all!

Tweet: The United States hasn’t had a Trade Surplus with China in 40 years. They must end unfair trade take down barriers and charge only Reciprocal Tariffs. The U.S. is losing $500 Billion a year and has been losing Billions of Dollars for decades. Cannot continue!

Tweet: We are sealing up our Southern Border. The people of our great country want Safety and Security. The Dems have been a disaster on this very important issue!

Tweet: Lawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse FBI Comey Lynch McCabe Clinton Emails and much more. Slow walking - what is going on? BAD!

Tweet: What does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide? Why aren’t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? Stalling but for what reason? Not looking good!

Tweet: Fire at Trump Tower is out. Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!

Tweet: While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air &amp; Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!

Tweet: “The FBI closed the case on Hillary which was a rigged investigation. They exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her they never even put her under oath.....” and much more. So true Jesse! @WattersWorld

Tweet: The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up made garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names) many of which don’t exist. Story on John Kelly isn’t true...just another hit job!

Tweet: President Xi and I will always be friends no matter what happens with our dispute on trade. China will take down its Trade Barriers because it is the right thing to do. Taxes will become Reciprocal &amp; a deal will be made on Intellectual Property. Great future for both countries!

Tweet: If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!

Tweet: Congratulations to Patrick Reed on his great and courageous MASTERS win! When Patrick had his amazing win at Doral 5 years ago people saw his great talent and a bright future ahead. Now he is the Masters Champion!

Tweet: When a car is sent to the United States from China there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years!

Tweet: The Democrats are not doing what’s right for our country. I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law!

Tweet: Great @Cabinet meeting at the @WhiteHouse this morning!

Tweet: Attorney–client privilege is dead!

Tweet: A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!

Tweet: Last night it was my great honor to host America’s senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the White House. America’s military is the GREATEST fighting force in the history of the world. They all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform!

Tweet: Very thankful for President Xi of China’s kind words on tarrifs and automobile barriers...also his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers. We will make great progress together!

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to welcome the 2017 NCAA Football National Champion Alabama Crimson Tide - to the White House. Congratulations!

Tweet: The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story. It was political pundit Doug Schoen not a Ukrainian businessman who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype) hosted by Doug in Ukraine. I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia C story!

Tweet: So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House. Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China the coming North Korea meeting and of course the vicious gas attack in Syria. Feels great to have Bolton &amp; Larry K on board. I (we) are

Tweet: Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia because they will be coming nice and new and “smart!” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!

Tweet: Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?

Tweet: Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake &amp; Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA &amp; Comey letter). No Collusion so they go crazy!

Tweet: Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man and while he will not be seeking re-election he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!

Tweet: The @WhiteHouse is partnering with @Interior and @NatlParkService to bring the @NSCsafety's “Prescribed to Death” Opioid Memorial to the Ellipse - beginning tomorrow April 12th to April 18th. More information:

Tweet: Honored to have Republican Congressional Leadership join me at the @WhiteHouse this evening. Lots to discuss as we continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Big show tonight on @seanhannity! 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews

Tweet: If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December as reported by the Failing New York Times I would have fired him. Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper!

Tweet: California Governor Jerry Brown is doing the right thing and sending the National Guard to the Border. Thank you Jerry good move for the safety of our Country!

Tweet: Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all! In any event the United States under my Administration has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS. Where is our “Thank you America?”

Tweet: Good luck to Mike Pompeo during his Confirmation Hearing today. He will be a great Secretary of State!

Tweet: On Yom HaShoah we remember the six million Jews slaughtered in the Holocaust. With each passing year our duty to remember this atrocity increases as we pledge #NeverAgain. #HolocaustRemembranceDay

Tweet: I have agreed with the historically cooperative disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!). I have full confidence in Ty Cobb my Special Counsel and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process.

Tweet: Just had an Agricultural Roundtable with memembers of Congress and Governors.I will be making remarks on the large scale TAX CUTS given to American families and workers at 1:45 P.M. from the Rose Garden. Join me live:

Tweet: Thank you to all of the American workers who travelled here today! This event is dedicated to YOU: the hardworking Americans who make this nation run. You love your country you provide for your family you have PRIDE in your work and you cherish our GREAT AMERICAN FLAG! #TaxCuts

Tweet: America’s greatest treasure is our people – and my Administration HEARS YOUR VOICE and HAS YOUR BACK. We are fighting to give every American a future of dignity purpose and pride. AMERICAN SPIRIT is back! #TaxCuts

Tweet: Would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres. Obama. We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations Japan who has hit us hard on trade for years!

Tweet: Tremendous pressure is building like never before for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities. Started the Wall in San Diego where the people were pushing really hard to get it. They will soon be protected!

Tweet: We are bringing back our factories we are bringing back our jobs and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: MADE IN THE USA!

Tweet: DOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!

Tweet: A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!

Tweet: So proud of our great Military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our Country has ever had. There won’t be anything or anyone even close!

Tweet: Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job. Slimeball!

Tweet: The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like how come he gave up Classified Information (jail) why did he lie to Congress (jail) why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it) why the phony memos McCabe’s $700000 &amp; more?

Tweet: Comey throws AG Lynch “under the bus!” Why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat or AG in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!

Tweet: The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term “Mission Accomplished.” I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back. Use often!

Tweet: I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE!

Tweet: Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!

Tweet: Slippery James Comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!) will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history by far!

Tweet: Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News it’s hard to believe! Thank you America we are doing Great Things.

Tweet: Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G) then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled he McCabe and the others committed many crimes!

Tweet: Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!

Tweet: Employment is up Taxes are DOWN. Enjoy!

Tweet: I am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Working on Trade and Military Security.

Tweet: So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill. Everyone is talking really nice to see!

Tweet: Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border. He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border. The high crime rate will only get higher. Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started!

Tweet: Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan a truly fine gentleman!

Tweet: Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media. They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day. Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post and they haven’t changed (get new pollsters). Much of the media is a Scam!

Tweet: Welcome Prime Minister Abe!

Tweet: States and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers. Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!

Tweet: .@FLOTUS Melania and I join the Nation in celebrating the life of Barbara Bush:

Tweet: .@FLOTUS Melania and I join the Nation in celebrating the life of Barbara Bush:

Tweet: It is my great honor to host @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo!

Tweet: Pastor Andrew Brunson a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason. They call him a Spy but I am more a Spy than he is. Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!

Tweet: While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP I don’t like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S.

Tweet: There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous crime infested &amp; breeding concept. Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border but the people of the State are not happy. Want Security &amp; Safety NOW!

Tweet: A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!

Tweet: Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week. Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World but also for North Korea!

Tweet: Slippery James Comey the worst FBI Director in history was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where by the way there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!

Tweet: Best wishes to Prime Minister @Netanyahu and all of the people of Israel on the 70th Anniversary of your Great Independence. We have no better friends anywhere. Looking forward to moving our Embassy to Jerusalem next month!

Tweet: Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan and myself this morning building an even deeper and better relationship while playing a quick round of golf at Trump International Golf Club.

Tweet: Great working luncheon with U.S. and Japanese Delegations this afternoon!

Tweet: It was my great honor to host my friend @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo and his delegation at Mar-a-Lago for the past two days. Lots accomplished thank you! #Success🇺🇸🇯🇵

Tweet: Great meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan who has just left Florida. Talked in depth about North Korea Military and Trade. Good things will happen!

Tweet: Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies. California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities putting all Americans at risk.

Tweet: Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy “up to 400 National Guard Troops” to do nothing. The crime rate in California is high enough and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown’s charade. We need border security and action not words!

Tweet: Just arrived @NASKeyWest! Heading to a briefing with the Joint Interagency Task Force South NORTHCOM and SOUTHCOM.

Tweet: THANK YOU #JIATFSouth @Norad_Northcom @southcomwatch and @DHSgov. Keep up the GREAT work!

Tweet: .@MarshaBlackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. Great on the Military Border Security and Crime. Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee. She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her!

Tweet: Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government hence the American People. They are “slow walking” all of my nominations - hundreds of people. At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!

Tweet: Mike Pompeo is outstanding. First in his class at West Point. A top student at Harvard Law School. A success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State!

Tweet: My thoughts prayers and condolences are with the families friends and colleagues of the two @GCSOFlorida deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today.

Tweet: Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. We are doing a great job of law enforcement but things such as this make safety in America difficult!

Tweet: James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe “under the bus.” Inspector General’s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?

Tweet: James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?

Tweet: So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don’t think so!

Tweet: So exciting! I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis Maryland. Looking forward to being there.

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans...got not one Democrat Vote! Here’s a choice. They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts!

Tweet: Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place including the fully loaded ships at sea Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!

Tweet: Can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the Fake News Media (should be getting good stories) today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers including those on Election Day? The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press. Make America Great Again!

Tweet: Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI the Wendy Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.

Tweet: North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit.

Tweet: Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.

Tweet: James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really does everybody know what that means?

Tweet: A message from Kim Jong Un: “North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.”Also will “Shut down a nuclear test site in the country’s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.” Progress being made for all!

Tweet: Join me in Washington Michigan on Saturday April 28 2018 at 7:00pm! #MAGA Tickets:

Tweet: Fantastic crowd and great people yesterday in Key West Florida. Thank you!

Tweet: Today my thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family. In memory of First Lady Barbara Bush there is a remembrance display located at her portrait in the Center Hall of the @WhiteHouse.

Tweet: Heading to the Southern White House to watch the Funeral Service of Barbara Bush. First Lady Melania has arrived in Houston to pay our respects. Will be a beautiful day!

Tweet: So funny the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning. Now he R’s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material including Servers and Emails!

Tweet: Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years most thought it would be done but yes I am considering a Full Pardon!

Tweet: James Comey’s Memos are Classified I did not Declassify them. They belong to our Government! Therefore he broke the law! Additionally he totally made up many of the things he said I said and he is already a proven liar and leaker. Where are Memos on Clinton Lynch &amp; others?

Tweet: The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as “Mr. Magoo” and Rod Rosenstein as “Mr. Peepers.” This is “according to people with whom the president has spoken.” There are no such people and don’t know these characters...just more Fake &amp; Disgusting News to create ill will!

Tweet: “At least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information.” Wall Street Journal

Tweet: “GOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton.” @FoxNews Good luck with that request!

Tweet: Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea and they have given up nothing. Wow we haven’t given up anything &amp; they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World) site closure &amp; no more testing!

Tweet: “I can die happy now with Trump Job performance” stated Mary Matalin. “A great overall President stunning!” Thank you Mary.

Tweet: A complete Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Funny how all of the Pundits that couldn’t come close to making a deal on North Korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal!

Tweet: Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos “you got to ask what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There’s no there there.” Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!

Tweet: Thank you to the incredible Law Enforcement Officers from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office. They keep us safe and are very cool about it!

Tweet: Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State. The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people including the Ambassador to Germany. They are maxing out the time on approval process for all never happened before. Need more Republicans!

Tweet: Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL

Tweet: Mexico whose laws on immigration are very tough must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also we must get Wall funding fast.

Tweet: Here’s a great stat - since January 2017 the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million. The American people are finally back to work!

Tweet: Having great meetings and discussions with my friend President @EmmanuelMacron of France. We are in the midst of meetings on Iran Syria and Trade. We will be holding a joint press conference shortly here at the @WhiteHouse. 🇺🇸🇫🇷

Tweet: Americans stand with you and all of Canada Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all. #TorontoStrong

Tweet: Arizona please get out today and vote @DebbieLesko for Congress in #AZ08. Strong on Border Immigration and Crime. Great on the Military. Time is ticking down - get out and VOTE today. We need Debbie in Congress!

Tweet: “President Trump Calls the U.S.-France Relationship ‘Unbreakable.’ History Shows He’s Right.”

Tweet: .@JimRenacci has worked so hard on Tax Reductions Illegal Immigration the Border and Crime. I need Jim very badly to help our agenda and to keep MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! He will be a fantastic Senator for the Great State of Ohio and has my full endorsement!

Tweet: Today @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome French President @EmmanuelMacron and Mrs. Brigitte Macron to the @WhiteHouse. We look forward to hosting them at tonight's State Dinner in their honor.

Tweet: Our two great republics are linked together by the timeless bonds of history culture and destiny. We are people who cherish our values protect our civilization and recognize the image of God in every human soul.

Tweet: Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat. Debbie will do a Great Job! Press is so silent.

Tweet: Busy day planned. Looking forward to watching President Macron of France address a Joint Session of Congress today. This is a great honor and seldom allowed to be done...he will be GREAT!

Tweet: .@FLOTUS did a spectacular job hosting the President of France @EmmanuelMacron and his wife Brigitte. Every detail was done to perfection. The State Dining Room never looked more beautiful and Washington is abuzz over what an incredible job Melania did.

Tweet: Looking forward to my meeting with Tim Cook of Apple. We will be talking about many things including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for many years by many countries on trade.

Tweet: Thank you Kanye very cool!

Tweet: MAGA!

Tweet: I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M. Enjoy!

Tweet: Loved being on @foxandfriends this morning. Great show!

Tweet: The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada &amp; Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?

Tweet: Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey can’t define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. He’s either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor!

Tweet: After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening but only time will tell!

Tweet: KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States and all of its GREAT people should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!

Tweet: So great to have Staff Sgt. Dan Nevins and the incredible WOUNDED WARRIORS with me in the White House yesterday. These are truly brave and special people! @foxandfriends

Tweet: Please do not forget the great help that my good friend President Xi of China has given to the United States particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer tougher process!

Tweet: Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff! Thank you also to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott they really get it (lowest Black &amp; Hispanic unemployment in history).

Tweet: Look forward to meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany today. So much to discuss so little time! It will be good for both of our great countries!

Tweet: Just Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released. “No evidence” that the Trump Campaign “colluded coordinated or conspired with Russia.” Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow! A total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW!

Tweet: I urge all Americans to participate in #takebackday tomorrow! Let’s come together and BEAT last October’s record of disposed prescription pills! Visit to learn more on how to participate Saturday and every day.

Tweet: House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Councel appointed. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: “Clapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN” @foxandfriends FoxNews He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN.

Tweet: Just had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea. Things are going very well time and location of meeting with North Korea is being set. Also spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations.

Tweet: Look forward to being in the Great State of Michigan tonight. Major business expansion and jobs pouring into your State. Auto companies expanding at record pace. Big crowd tonight will be live on T.V.

Tweet: Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Tester’s statements on Admiral Jackson are not true. There were no such findings. A horrible thing that we in D.C. must live with just like phony Russian Collusion. Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick!

Tweet: Join me LIVE in Washington Michigan at 7:00pmE on @FoxNews! #MAGA

Tweet: Great evening last night in Washington Michigan. The enthusiasm knowledge and love in that room was unreal. To the many thousands of people who couldn’t get in I cherish you....and will be back!

Tweet: While Washington Michigan was a big success Washington D.C. just didn’t work. Everyone is talking about the fact that the White House Correspondents Dinner was a very big boring bust...the so-called comedian really “bombed.” @greggutfeld should host next year! @PeteHegseth

Tweet: Just got recent Poll - much higher than President O at same time....Well much more has been accomplished!

Tweet: “Trump’s Triumphs are driving his critics Crazy!” Thank you Steve Hilton @NextRevFNC just want to do what is right for our wonderful U.S.A.

Tweet: The White House Correspondents’ Dinner was a failure last year but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy “comedian” totally bombed (couldn’t even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest or start over!

Tweet: Headline: “Kim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U.S. Pledges Not to Invade” - from the Failing New York Times. Also will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May.

Tweet: The White House Correspondents’ Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night!

Tweet: Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING but would Peace House/Freedom House on the Border of North &amp; South Korea be a more Representative Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!

Tweet: I recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits. I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts. #DrainTheSwamp

Tweet: The migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak &amp; ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda – Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First.

Tweet: During Small Business Week we celebrate the great hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business!

Tweet: The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don’t exist). They are totally unhinged and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can’t believe they are saying. Truly bad people!

Tweet: The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going “bonkers!”

Tweet: So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were “leaked” to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh I see...you have a made up phony crime Collusion that never existed and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!

Tweet: Delegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country. Very much like North Korea this should have been fixed years ago not now. Same with other countries and NAFTA...but it will all get done. Great Potential for USA!

Tweet: It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Yesterday it was my great honor to welcome President @MBuhari of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the @WhiteHouse!🇺🇸🇳🇬

Tweet: Today I had the great honor of awarding the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy for the first time in 21 years to the @ArmyWP_Football Black Knights at the @WhiteHouse.

Tweet: Congratulations @ArmyWP_Football!

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to thank and welcome heroic crew members and passengers of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 at the @WhiteHouse!

Tweet: There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup &amp; trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits Negotiations on NAFTA and much more. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: “The questions are an intrusion into the President’s Article 2 powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee...what the President was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the President’s unfettered power to fire anyone...” Joe Digenova former US Attorney

Tweet: NEW BOOK - A MUST READ! “The Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump” by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett. A sad chapter for law enforcement. A rigged system!

Tweet: A Rigged System - They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal “justice?” At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!

Tweet: Congratulations @SecPompeo!

Tweet: I have been briefed on the U.S. C-130 “Hercules” cargo plane from the Puerto Rico National Guard that crashed near Savannah Hilton Head International Airport. Please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims their families and the great men and women of the National Guard.

Tweet: “This isn’t some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.” John Dowd March 2018. With North Korea China the Middle East and so much more there is not much time to be thinking about this especially since there was no Russian “Collusion.”

Tweet: As everybody is aware the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp but to no avail. Stay tuned!

Tweet: Ainsley Earnhardt a truly great person just wrote a wonderful book “The Light Within Me” which is doing really well. She is very special and so is her new book...bring it to number one!

Tweet: Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade! I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future. We will always have a good (great) relationship!

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to celebrate the #NationalDayOfPrayer at the @WhiteHouse in the Rose Garden! Proclamation:

Tweet: This spring marks 4yrs since the Phoenix VA crisis. We won't forget what happened to our GREAT VETS. Choice is vital but the program needs work &amp; is running out of $. Congress must fix Choice Program by Memorial Day so VETS can get the care they deserve. I will sign immediately!

Tweet: #NationalDayOfPrayer

Tweet: Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall. Mexico which has a massive crime problem is doing little to help!

Tweet: Because Jobs in the U.S. are doing so well Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. Great!

Tweet: Andy McCarthy will be on @LouDobbs tonight. 7:00 P.M. @FoxBusiness.

Tweet: NBC NEWS is wrong again! They cite “sources” which are constantly wrong. Problem is like so many others the sources probably don’t exist they are fabricated fiction! NBC my former home with the Apprentice is now as bad as Fake News CNN. Sad!

Tweet: Going to Dallas (the GREAT State of Texas) today. Leaving soon!

Tweet: JUST OUT: 3.9% Unemployment. 4% is Broken! In the meantime WITCH HUNT!

Tweet: Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office!

Tweet: We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR. Illegal immigration must end!

Tweet: I want to thank all of our friends and patriots at the @NRA. We will never fail and we will always protect your Second Amendment! God Bless you and God Bless America!

Tweet: Great book just out by very successful businessman @AndyPuzder. Always known as somebody who knows how to win “Capitalist Comeback” will be a big hit!

Tweet: Just returned home to the beautiful White House from Dallas where the Arena was packed to the rafters with the great fans and supporters of the @NRA. It was so wonderful to be there!

Tweet: Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives. We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!

Tweet: Thank you Cleveland Ohio!

Tweet: To the great people of West Virginia we have together a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is Don Blankenship currently running for Senate can’t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!

Tweet: My highly respected nominee for CIA Director Gina Haspel has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists. Think of that in these very dangerous times we have the most qualified person a woman who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!

Tweet: The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up phony crime.There is no O it’s called Fighting Back

Tweet: The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‘till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!

Tweet: “The Great Revolt” by Salena Zito and Brad Todd does much to tell the story of our great Election victory. The Forgotten Men &amp; Women are forgotten no longer!

Tweet: Good luck to Ric Grenell our new Ambassador to Germany. A great and talented guy he will represent our Country well!

Tweet: Lisa Page who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover Peter S) and attorney Baker are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business!

Tweet: Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!

Tweet: The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal. He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!

Tweet: National Prescription Drug #TakeBackDay numbers are in! Another record broken: nearly 1 MILLION pounds of Rx pills disposed! Let’s keep fighting this opioid epidemic America!

Tweet: I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm.

Tweet: Gina Haspel my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA is being praised for the fact that she has been and alway will be TOUGH ON TERROR! This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. The CIA wants her to lead them into America’s bright and glorious future!

Tweet: I will be speaking to my friend President Xi of China this morning at 8:30. The primary topics will be Trade where good things will happen and North Korea where relationships and trust are building.

Tweet: John Kerry can’t get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John you are hurting your country!

Tweet: Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal:

Tweet: The Republican Party had a great night. Tremendous voter energy and excitement and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November. The Economy is sooo strong and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes why wouldn’t we win?

Tweet: The Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy &amp; all things else 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?

Tweet: Candace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart “thinkers” and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country!

Tweet: Congratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio. He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs. His Socialist opponent in November should not do well a big failure in last job!

Tweet: I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health. Also good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date &amp; Place set.

Tweet: Secretary Pompeo and his “guests” will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 A.M. in the morning. I will be there to greet them. Very exciting!

Tweet: The Failing New York Times criticized Secretary of State Pompeo for being AWOL (missing) when in fact he was flying to North Korea. Fake News so bad!

Tweet: Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A.M.

Tweet: Gina Haspel did a spectacular job today. There is nobody even close to run the CIA!

Tweet: On behalf of the American people WELCOME HOME!

Tweet: Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal even going at it with President Obama &amp; then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him!

Tweet: Five Most Wanted leaders of ISIS just captured!

Tweet: The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!

Tweet: Thank you Indiana!

Tweet: Today my Administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American People. We will have tougher negotiation more competition and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter!

Tweet: The American people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them – not one that takes advantage of them. We will work every day to ensure all Americans have access to the quality affordable medication they need and deserve. We will not rest until the job is done!

Tweet: Big week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem. Congratulations to all!

Tweet: Why doesn’t the Fake News Media state that the Trump Administration’s Anti-Trust Division has been and is opposed to the AT&amp;T purchase of Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial. Such a disgrace in reporting!

Tweet: North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th. Thank you a very smart and gracious gesture!

Tweet: Iran’s Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie. But not anymore!

Tweet: The Senate should get funding done before the August break or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct all they know how to do. STAY!

Tweet: Happy Mother’s Day!!!

Tweet: President Xi of China and I are working together to give massive Chinese phone company ZTE a way to get back into business fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!

Tweet: China and the United States are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool it will all work out!

Tweet: Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place. They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Now that will not happen!

Tweet: So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris. At some point countries will have to open their eyes &amp; see what is really going on. This kind of sickness &amp; hatred is not compatible with a loving peaceful &amp; successful country! Changes to our thought process on terror must be made.

Tweet: U.S. Embassy opening in Jerusalem will be covered live on @FoxNews &amp; @FoxBusiness. Lead up to 9:00 A.M. (eastern) event has already begun. A great day for Israel!

Tweet: Big day for Israel. Congratulations!

Tweet: #USEmbassyJerusalem

Tweet: ZTE the large Chinese phone company buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi.

Tweet: The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said leakers are traitors and cowards and we will find out who they are!

Tweet: Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady Melania. Successful procedure she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!

Tweet: Wow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI “SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN IMBEDDED INFORMANT.” Andrew McCarthy says “There’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.” If so this is bigger than Watergate!

Tweet: Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don’t worry about Dems FISA Abuse missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!

Tweet: What ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes &amp; offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server?

Tweet: China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!

Tweet: On China Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time.

Tweet: China must continue to be strong &amp; tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made. The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. I want this to happen and North Korea to be VERY successful but only after signing!

Tweet: The Wall Street Journal asks “WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA?” A very good question!

Tweet: Under our potential deal with China they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce.

Tweet: “Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign” No James Clapper I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot!

Tweet: Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.

Tweet: Big legislation will be signed by me shortly. After many years RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK.

Tweet: There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries you have waited long enough!

Tweet: Governor Henry McMaster is a truly fine man who loves the People of South Carolina. He was one of my very early supporters and truly helped me to a Big South Carolina Victory. I will see you all in S.C on Monday and Vice President Pence will be there for Henry on Saturday!

Tweet: Congresswoman Martha Roby of Alabama has been a consistent and reliable vote for our Make America Great Again Agenda. She is in a Republican Primary run-off against a recent Nancy Pelosi voting Democrat. I fully endorse Martha for Alabama 2nd Congressional District!

Tweet: Congressman Ron DeSantis a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida. Ron is strong on Borders tough on Crime &amp; big on Cutting Taxes - Loves our Military &amp; our Vets. He will be a Great Governor &amp; has my full Endorsement!

Tweet: 80% of Mexico’s Exports come to the United States. They totally rely on us which is fine with me. They do have though very strong Immigration Laws. The U.S. has pathetically weak and ineffective Immigration Laws that the Democrats refuse to help us fix. Will speak to Mexico!

Tweet: We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures and did nothing about it!

Tweet: Hope OPEC will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!

Tweet: Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. and it great companies and workers by the European Union if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!

Tweet: We are gathered today to hear directly from the AMERICAN VICTIMS of ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. These are the American Citizens permanently separated from their loved ones b/c they were killed by criminal illegal aliens. These are the families the media

Tweet: Our first duty and our highest loyalty is to the citizens of the United States. We will not rest until our border is secure our citizens are safe and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all.

Tweet: Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. &amp; its great companies and workers by the European Union if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!

Tweet: Steel is coming back fast! U.S. Steel is adding great capacity also. So are others.

Tweet: .@FoxNews Poll numbers plummet on the Democrat inspired and paid for Russian Witch Hunt. With all of the bias lying and hate by the investigators people want the investigators investigated. Much more will come out. A total scam and excuse for the Dems losing the Election!

Tweet: The Russian Witch Hunt is Rigged!

Tweet: The National Association of Manufacturers just announced that 95.1% of Manufacturers “have a positive outlook for their companies.” This is the best number in the Association’s history!

Tweet: “Disability applications plunge as economy strengthens” Failing New York Times

Tweet: Drudge Report “OBAMA KEPT THEM IN CAGES WRAPPED THEM IN FOIL” We do a much better job while at the same time maintaining a MUCH stronger Border! Mainstream Fake Media hates this story.

Tweet: My thoughts and prayers are with Representative Katie Arrington of South Carolina including all of those involved in last nights car accident and their families.

Tweet: Heading to Nevada to talk trade and immigration with supporters. Country’s economy is stronger than ever before with numbers that are getting better by the week. Tremendous potential and trade deals are coming along well.

Tweet: It’s very sad that Nancy Pelosi and her sidekick Cryin’ Chuck Schumer want to protect illegal immigrants far more than the citizens of our country. The United States cannot stand for this. We wants safety and security at our borders!

Tweet: Happy Birthday to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas a friend and great man!

Tweet: Thank you @NVGOP! #MAGA

Tweet: AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!

Tweet: Major Wall Street Journal opinion piece today talking about the Russian Witch Hunt and the disgrace that it is. So many people hurt so bad for our country - a total

Tweet: Democrats fix the laws. Don’t RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders No Crime!

Tweet: The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country remove those Barriers &amp; Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A. Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!

Tweet: .@jimmyfallon is now whimpering to all that he did the famous “hair show” with me (where he seriously messed up my hair) &amp; that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have “humanized” me-he is taking heat. He called &amp; said “monster ratings.” Be a man Jimmy!

Tweet: .@ClayHiggins18 has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes creating great new healthcare programs at low cost fighting for Border Security our Military and are Vets. He is tough on Crime and has my full Endorsement. The Great State of Louisiana we want Clay!

Tweet: House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember it still has to pass in the Senate and for that we need 10 Democrat votes and all they do is RESIST. They want Open Borders and don’t care about Crime! Need more Republicans to WIN in November!

Tweet: .@RepClayHiggins has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes creating great new healthcare programs at low cost fighting for Border Security our Military and are Vets. He is tough on Crime and has my full Endorsement. The Great State of Louisiana we want Clay!

Tweet: Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower. Actually far greater than would ever have been believed!

Tweet: The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside!

Tweet: I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to) because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ &amp; FBI aren’t giving over requested documents?

Tweet: Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama. Fake News is working overtime!

Tweet: Will be heading to one of my favorite places South Carolina to fight for one of my original “fighters” Governor Henry McMaster. Speaking at 7:00 P.M.

Tweet: Congresswoman Maxine Waters an extraordinarily low IQ person has become together with Nancy Pelosi the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters of which there are many of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!

Tweet: Surprised that Harley-Davidson of all companies would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U. which has hurt us badly on trade down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient! #MAGA

Tweet: “Director David Lynch: Trump Could Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents”

Tweet: Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) perhaps in a near drunken state claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt knows? Isn’t this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?

Tweet: The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI &amp; DOJ should be shown to the public on live television not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!

Tweet: Just landed in South Carolina - will be at the McMaster rally shortly! #MAGA

Tweet: Thank you South Carolina. Now let’s get out tomorrow and VOTE for @HenryMcMaster!

Tweet: It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina. Henry is tough on Crime and Borders loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy. GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!

Tweet: A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move watch it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!

Tweet: The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who together with Nancy Pelosi have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres.

Tweet: “The most profound question of our era: Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U.S. and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy?” Judge Andrew Napolitano

Tweet: SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!

Tweet: Today we tell the story of an incredible HERO who defended our nation in World War Two – First Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner. Although he died 20 years ago today he takes his rightful place in the Eternal Chronicle of American

Tweet: Congratulations to Governor Henry McMaster on your BIG election win! South Carolina loves you. We are all proud of you and Peggy! @henrymcmaster

Tweet: Tremendous win for Congressman Dan Donovan. You showed great courage in a tough race! New York and my many friends on Staten Island have elected someone they have always been very proud of. Congratulations!

Tweet: Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi’s place just LOST his primary election. In other words he’s out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer and more respectful to his President!

Tweet: The Democrats are in Turmoil! Open Borders and unchecked Crime a certain way to lose elections. Republicans are for Strong Borders NO Crime! A BIG NIGHT!

Tweet: A great First Lady!

Tweet: The legendary Gary Player at Turnberry in Scotland!

Tweet: Big and conclusive win by Mitt Romney. Congratulations! I look forward to working together - there is so much good to do. A great and loving family will be coming to D.C.

Tweet: Congratulations to Maxine Waters whose crazy rants have made her together with Nancy Pelosi the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party. Together they will Make America Weak Again! But have no fear America is now stronger than ever before and I’m not going anywhere!

Tweet: HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON’T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS &amp; SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME. WIN!

Tweet: Supreme Court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now as an example able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the Union deciding for them. Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!

Tweet: Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America with the people that got you your success. I’ve done so much for you and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won’t forget and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!

Tweet: Statement on Justice Anthony Kennedy. #SCOTUS

Tweet: Heading to North Dakota to fully stand with and endorse Kevin Cramer for Senate. He is an extraordinary Congressman who will hopefully soon represent this great state as your Senator. He is tough on crime strong on borders loves our Military and our Vets! #NDSen

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to welcome President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of Portugal to the @WhiteHouse!🇺🇸🇵🇹

Tweet: Just landed in North Dakota with @SenJohnHoeven and @RepKevinCramer. We will see everyone at Scheels Arena shortly!

Tweet: Thank you North Dakota. Together we are MAKING AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #MAGA

Tweet: Lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday’s closed door testimony and according to most reports refused to answer many questions. There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted is Rigged!

Tweet: Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server and why didn’t Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn’t Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions so much corruption!

Tweet: Amy Kremer Women for Trump was so great on @foxandfriends. Brave and very smart thank you Amy! @AmyKremer

Tweet: Just watched @SharkGregNorman on @foxandfriends. Said “President is doing a great job. All over the world people want to come back to the U.S.” Thank you Greg and you’re looking and doing great!

Tweet: Peter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller/Comey best friends!

Tweet: I am in Milwaukee Wisconsin for meetings. Soon to leave for a big groundbreaking for Foxconn which is building a great new electronics plant in Wisconsin. 15000 Jobs so great!

Tweet: Today we broke ground on a plant that will provide jobs for up to 15000 Wisconsin Workers! As Foxconn has discovered there is no better place to build hire and grow than right here in the United States!

Tweet: AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!

Tweet: Prior to departing Wisconsin I was briefed on the shooting at Capital Gazette in Annapolis Maryland. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. Thank you to all of the First Responders who are currently on the scene.

Tweet: Six months after our TAX CUTS more than 6 MILLION workers have received bonuses pay raises and retirement account contributions.#TaxCutsandJobsAct

Tweet: The new plant being built by Foxconn in Wisconsin is incredible. Congratulations to the people of Wisconsin and to Governor Scott Walker @GovWalker and his talented representatives for having pulled it off. Great job!

Tweet: The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE one of the smartest toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 &amp; clean out the toughest of situations. They are great!

Tweet: To the great and brave men and women of ICE do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance It will never happen!

Tweet: Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that because of the turmoil &amp; disfunction in Iran and Venezuela I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production maybe up to 2000000 barrels to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!

Tweet: I will be making my choice for Justice of the United States Supreme Court on the first Monday after the July 4th Holiday July 9th!

Tweet: A friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will Sean Spicer has written a great new book “The Briefing: Politics the Press and the President.” It is a story told with both heart and knowledge. Really good go get it!

Tweet: I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill either GOODLATTE 1 or 2 because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov.

Tweet: Either we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote or Filibuster rule - or better yet do both. Cryin’ Chuck would do it on day one but we’ll never give him the chance. Some great legislation awaits - be smart!

Tweet: I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on Sunday on @FoxNews at 10:00 A. M. Enjoy!

Tweet: When people come into our Country illegally we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!

Tweet: I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. on @FoxNews

Tweet: The Liberal Left also known as the Democrats want to get rid of ICE who do a fantastic job and want Open Borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable! Make America Great Again

Tweet: A big week especially with our numerous victories in the Supreme Court. Heading back to the White House now. Focus will be on the selection of a new Supreme Court Justice. Exciting times for our country. Economy may be stronger than it has ever been!

Tweet: Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands to the @WhiteHouse!

Tweet: Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their “leadership” wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE thereby declaring war on Law &amp; Order. These people will be voting for Republicans in November and in many cases joining the Republican Party!

Tweet: Crazy Maxine Waters said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics is rapidly becoming together with Nancy Pelosi the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving even referring to herself as a wounded animal will make people flee the Democrats!

Tweet: I interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday. On Monday I will be announcing my decision for Justice of the United States Supreme Court!

Tweet: The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before and that’s prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country. In any event they are coming along very well. Most countries agree that they must be changed but nobody ever asked!

Tweet: When we have an “infestation” of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.

Tweet: How can the Democrats who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime do well in November. The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security while the Democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement!

Tweet: Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well! In the meantime no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party which includes the Fake News is complaining. If not for me we would now be at War with North Korea!

Tweet: Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation to 2500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?

Tweet: Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S. my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017. The U.S. is where the Action is!

Tweet: Wow! The NSA has deleted 685 million phone calls and text messages. Privacy violations? They blame technical irregularities. Such a disgrace. The Witch Hunt continues!

Tweet: The Washington Post is constantly quoting “anonymous sources” that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a discgrace to journalism but then again so are many others!

Tweet: After having written many best selling books and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis not b/c they should be capitalized!

Tweet: Heading to West Virginia to be with my friend @WVGovernor Jim Justice at his beautiful Greenbrier Resort. He works hard does a great job and raises lots of money for charities!

Tweet: The Washington Post is constantly quoting “anonymous sources” that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a disgrace to journalism but then again so are many others!

Tweet: Just arrived in West Virginia!

Tweet: After having written many best selling books and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis not b/c they should be capitalized!

Tweet: Thank you @WVGovernor Jim Justice for that warm introduction. Tonight it was my great honor to attend the “Greenbrier Classic – Salute to Service Dinner” in West Virginia! God Bless our Veterans. God Bless America - and HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY TO ALL!

Tweet: Tomorrow families across our Nation will gather to celebrate the Fourth of July. As we do we will think of the men &amp; women serving overseas at this very moment far away from their families protecting America - &amp; we will thank GOD for blessing us with these incredible HEROES!

Tweet: Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!

Tweet: The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up &amp; they are doing little to help. If anything they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $’s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!

Tweet: Happy Birthday America!

Tweet: Congress - FIX OUR INSANE IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW!

Tweet: It was my great honor to join proud hardworking American Patriots in Montana tonight. I love you - thank you! #MAGA

Tweet: A vote for Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities to let drugs pour into our cities and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking Americans. Democrats want anarchy amnesty and chaos - Republicans want LAW ORDER and JUSTICE!

Tweet: Every day the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities from savage gangs like MS-13. We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL!

Tweet: Thanks to REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP America is WINNING AGAIN - and America is being RESPECTED again all over the world. Because we are finally putting AMERICA FIRST!

Tweet: JOBS JOBS JOBS!

Tweet: Just won lawsuit filed by the DNC and a bunch of Democrat crazies trying to claim the Trump Campaign (and others) colluded with Russia. They haven’t figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election!

Tweet: Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon the Washington Post who constantly quote anonymous sources that in my opinion don’t exist - They will both be out of business in 7 years!

Tweet: Big decision will soon be made on our next Justice of the Supreme Court!

Tweet: Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the “Special” Councel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous) that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation &amp; that the only Collusion was with the Dems!

Tweet: Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the “Special” Counsel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous) that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation &amp; that the only Collusion was with the Dems!

Tweet: The Rigged Witch Hunt originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) &amp; now 13 Angry Democrats should look into the missing DNC Server Crooked Hillary’s illegally deleted Emails the Pakistani Fraudster Uranium One Podesta &amp; so much more. It’s a Democrat Con Job!

Tweet: The U.S. is working very closely with the Government of Thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety. Very brave and talented people!

Tweet: Looking forward to announcing my final decision on the United States Supreme Court Justice at 9:00pmE tomorrow night at the @WhiteHouse. An exceptional person will be chosen!

Tweet: They just didn't get it but they do now!

Tweet: I have long heard that the most important decision a U.S. President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice - Will be announced tonight at 9:00 P.M.

Tweet: I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed &amp; even more importantly our handshake. We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea. China on the other hand may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade-Hope Not!

Tweet: The failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out. The U.S. strongly supports breast feeding but we don’t believe women should be denied access to formula. Many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty.

Tweet: Pfizer &amp; others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason. They are merely taking advantage of the poor &amp; others unable to defend themselves while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe &amp; elsewhere. We will respond!

Tweet: HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY to our amazing current and former Army Warrant Officers. Thank you for your century of service as the indispensable guardians of our great @USArmy’s technology! #CenturyOfService

Tweet: Tonight it was my honor and privilege to nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. #SCOTUS

Tweet: Getting ready to leave for Europe. First meeting - NATO. The U.S. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. Not fair to the U.S. taxpayer. On top of that we lose $151 Billion on Trade with the European Union. Charge us big Tariffs (&amp; Barriers)!

Tweet: NATO countries must pay MORE the United States must pay LESS. Very Unfair!

Tweet: Thank you to all of my great supporters really big progress being made. Other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals. Economy is ROARING. Supreme Court pick getting GREAT REVIEWS. New Poll says Trump at over 90% is the most popular Republican in history of the Party. Wow!

Tweet: On behalf of the United States congratulations to the Thai Navy SEALs and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in Thailand. Such a beautiful moment - all freed great job!

Tweet: I am on Air Force One flying to NATO and hear reports that the FBI lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are getting cold feet on testifying about the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and people that worked for Obama for 8 years. Total disgrace!

Tweet: Informing the Republican Senators of my nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. #SCOTUS

Tweet: Many countries in NATO which we are expected to defend are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low) but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made. Will they reimburse the U.S.?

Tweet: A recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans especially Hispanics feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama.

Tweet: The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S. has a $151 Billion trade deficit) and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO and nicely pay for it. Just doesn’t work!

Tweet: Just talked with Pfizer CEO and @SecAzar on our drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price hikes so American patients don’t pay more. We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. Great news for the American people!

Tweet: Democrats in Congress must no longer Obstruct - vote to fix our terrible Immigration Laws now. I am watching what is going on from Europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. Judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. They are just using children!

Tweet: What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are their only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY not by 2025.

Tweet: If the Democrats want to win Supreme Court and other Court picks don’t Obstruct and Resist but rather do it the good ol’ fashioned way WIN ELECTIONS!

Tweet: Ex-FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress! Wow but is anybody really surprised! Together with her lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!

Tweet: How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!

Tweet: Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year at my request but it isn’t nearly enough. U.S. spends too much. Europe’s borders are BAD! Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable!

Tweet: As I head out to a very important NATO meeting I see that FBI Lover/Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena &amp; is refusing to show up and testify. What can she possibly say about her statements and lies. So much corruption on the other side. Where is the Attorney General? @FoxNews

Tweet: Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe and loses Big on Trade!

Tweet: #NATOSummit2018 Press Conference in Brussels

Tweet: Thank you #NATO2018!

Tweet: “Trump has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment. In June for instance the unemployment rate for Hispanics and Latinos 16 years and older fell to 4.6% its lowest level ever from 4.9% in May.”

Tweet: A very nice note from Chairman Kim of North Korea. Great progress being made!

Tweet: Great success today at NATO! Billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election. Great spirit!

Tweet: This is now changing - for the first time!

Tweet: I have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings calls and hopefully some golf - my primary form of exercise! The weather is beautiful and this place is incredible! Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin.

Tweet: The Stock Market hit 25000 yesterday. Jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government. It is all happening!

Tweet: The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration not the Trump Administrations. Why didn’t they do something about it especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the Election?

Tweet: Our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in Japan. We commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones.

Tweet: These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn’t Obama do something about it? Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win that’s why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration but Fake News doesn’t want to report the truth as usual!

Tweet: There hasn’t been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in North Korea there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages. Who knows how it will all turn out in the end but why isn’t the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts? Because it is FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: Congratulations to France who played extraordinary soccer on winning the 2018 World Cup. Additionally congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament -- one of the best ever!

Tweet: Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present &amp; future. We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong &amp; rich!

Tweet: President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling he said it couldn’t happen was no big deal &amp; did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!

Tweet: Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now the Rigged Witch Hunt!

Tweet: It was an honor to join you this morning. Thank you!

Tweet: Joint Press Conference from Helsinki Finland:

Tweet: Thank you Helsinki Finland!

Tweet: I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. #HELSINKI2018

Tweet: A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia but it is good for the world. #HELSINKI2018

Tweet: Will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9pmE and @TuckerCarlson tomorrow night at 8pmE. Enjoy!

Tweet: Thank you @RandPaul you really get it! “The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what’s he supposed think?”

Tweet: I had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future only because of me. NATO was weak but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders never mentions the money!

Tweet: While I had a great meeting with NATO raising vast amounts of money I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!

Tweet: Thank you @RandPaul. “The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what’s he supposed to think?”

Tweet: The economy of the United States is stronger than ever before!

Tweet: The meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success except in the Fake News Media!

Tweet: The Democrats want to abolish ICE which will mean more crime in our country. I want to give ICE a big cheer! Vote Republican in November.

Tweet: “Prosperity is returning. Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate now as the most effective president the most successful president in modern American history.” Thank you to the great Lou Dobbs!

Tweet: So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!

Tweet: Congratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress. My endorsement came appropriately late but when it came the “flood gates” opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve. Enjoy!

Tweet: “A lot of Democrats wished they voted for the Tax Cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the Fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again.” @foxandfriends @kilmeade

Tweet: Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome!

Tweet: 3.4 million jobs created since our great Election Victory - far greater than ever anticipated and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition!

Tweet: Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia. The Primary is on Tuesday. Brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration. He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement.

Tweet: Thank you to Congressman Kevin Yoder! He secured $5 BILLION for Border Security. Now we need Congress to support. Kevin has been strong on Crime the Border the 2nd Amendment and he loves our Military and Vets. @RepKevinYoder has my full and total endorsement!

Tweet: The two biggest opponents of ICE in America today are the Democratic Party and MS-13!

Tweet: A total disgrace that Turkey will not release a respected U.S. Pastor Andrew Brunson from prison. He has been held hostage far too long. @RT_Erdogan should do something to free this wonderful Christian husband &amp; father. He has done nothing wrong and his family needs him!

Tweet: Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. Likewise to Pfizer. We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices maybe substantially on prescription drugs.

Tweet: The Democrats have a death wish in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ICE. This should cost them heavily in the Midterms. Yesterday the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE!

Tweet: The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They make up stories without any backup sources or proof. Many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction. Problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity. But I’ll complain anyway!

Tweet: The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I’ll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!

Tweet: “Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES.” Thank you to @foxandfriends and @FoxNews for actually showing the clips. The Fake News wants no part of that narrative! Too bad they don’t want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set.

Tweet: Really big jobs meeting today at the White House! 3 P.M.

Tweet: I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S. but not for long!

Tweet: “Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES.”

Tweet: “Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES”

Tweet: Will the Dems and Fake News ever learn? This is classic!

Tweet: My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri. Such a tragedy such a great loss. May God be with you all!

Tweet: Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!

Tweet: So important. Should have been done years ago!

Tweet: I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud &amp; vicious I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!

Tweet: The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again - can’t believe it! Isn’t it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart? The $40000000 Commissioner must now make a stand. First time kneeling out for game. Second time kneeling out for season/no pay!

Tweet: Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of &amp; perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!

Tweet: The Rigged Witch Hunt headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added one who worked directly for Obama W.H.) seems intent on damaging the Republican Party’s chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 Election never ends!

Tweet: No Collusion No Obstruction - but that doesn’t matter because the 13 Angry Democrats who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!

Tweet: Brian Kemp who is running for Governor of Georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with @MikePenceVP. Brian is very strong on Crime and Borders LOVES our Military Vets and the 2nd Amendment. He will be a GREAT Governor!

Tweet: Brian Kemp who is running for Governor of Georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with VP @mike_pence. Brian is very strong on Crime and Borders LOVES our Military Vets and the 2nd Amendment. He will be a GREAT Governor!

Tweet: Troy Balderson of Ohio is running for Congress against a Nancy Pelosi Liberal who is WEAK on Crime &amp; Borders. Troy is the total opposite and loves our Military Vets &amp; 2nd Amendment. EARLY VOTING just started with Election Day on August 7th. Troy has my Full &amp; Total Endorsement!

Tweet: Watching Los Angeles possible hostage situation very closely. Active barricaded suspect. L.A.P.D. working with Federal Law Enforcement.

Tweet: Congratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents. As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of “Justice” and FBI misled the courts. Witch Hunt Rigged a Scam!

Tweet: Looking more &amp; more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!

Tweet: Andrew McCarthy - “I said this could never happen. This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it. It is so bad it screams out at you.” On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt!

Tweet: .@PeteHegseth on @FoxNews “Source #1 was the (Fake) Dossier. Yes the Dirty Dossier paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump and looking for information that could discredit Candidate #1 Trump. Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign...” ILLEGAL!

Tweet: I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. So bad for our country!

Tweet: Happy Birthday @SenatorDole!

Tweet: So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn’t he do something about it? Why didn’t he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax that’s why and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!

Tweet: To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE &amp; DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!

Tweet: Tom Fitton on @foxandfriends at 6:15 A.M. NOW! Judicial Watch.

Tweet: So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC that was knowingly &amp; falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!

Tweet: When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin and all that I gave up remember I gave up NOTHING we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the Corrupt Media!

Tweet: A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months. Likewise no Nuclear Tests. Japan is happy all of Asia is happy. But the Fake News is saying without ever asking me (always anonymous sources) that I am angry because it is not going fast enough. Wrong very happy!

Tweet: Robert will do a great job for our Vets. We also recently won Choice!

Tweet: Lou Barletta was one of my first supporters. He is tough on Crime and Borders. Will be a great Senator from Pennsylvania. His opponent is WEAK on Crime ICE and Borders. We need Lou!

Tweet: #MadeInAmerica Showcase!

Tweet: Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate. This should have taken place many years ago butas the saying goes better late than never!

Tweet: Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with Tariffs. It’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking! Remember we are the “piggy bank” that’s being robbed. All will be Great!

Tweet: Today is the day to vote for Brian Kemp. Will be great for Georgia full Endorsement!

Tweet: Our Country is doing GREAT. Best financial numbers on the Planet. Great to have USA WINNING AGAIN!

Tweet: Heading to Missouri to be with many of my great friends. VFW here we come!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: I’m very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don’t want Trump!

Tweet: #VFWConvention @VFWHQ

Tweet: I want to thank the @VFWHQ for your devotion to our fallen heroes unknown soldiers Prisoners of War those Missing in Action and their families. #VFWConvention

Tweet: On the heels of the VERY successful launch of the @WhiteHouse National Council for the American Worker Congress should reauthorize #PerkinsCTE and ensure the American workforce remains stronger than EVER! #Jobs #Workforce

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to be in Kansas City Missouri to pay tribute to the men and women who make FREEDOM possible! Thank you @VFWHQ! #VFWConvention

Tweet: The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it we are ready - but they won’t!

Tweet: So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn’t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People. Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved much bigger but not Sinclair. Disgraceful!

Tweet: “The Russia Hoax The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton &amp; Frame Donald Trump” is a Hot Seller already Number One! More importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about. It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly. Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett!

Tweet: Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off? Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness!

Tweet: When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. Negotiations are going really well be cool. The end result will be worth it!

Tweet: China is targeting our farmers who they know I love &amp; respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S. They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now! China made $517 Billion on us last year.

Tweet: What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!

Tweet: Congratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night. Wow 69-30 those are big numbers. Now go win against the open border crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you. She is weak on Vets the Military and the 2nd Amendment. Win!

Tweet: This week my Administration is hosting the first-ever #IRFMinisterial. The U.S. will continue to promote #ReligiousFreedom around the world. Nations that support religious freedom are far more free prosperous &amp; peaceful. Great job @VP @SecPompeo @IRF_Ambassador &amp; @StateDept!

Tweet: Sergio Marchionne who passed away today was one of the most brilliant &amp; successful car executives since the days of the legendary Henry Ford. It was a great honor for me to get to know Sergio as POTUS he loved the car industry and fought hard for it. He will be truly missed!

Tweet: Thank you very much working hard!

Tweet: Obviously the European Union as represented by @JunckerEU and the United States as represented by yours truly love each other!

Tweet: Thank you Georgia! They say that my endorsement last week of Brian Kemp in the Republican Primary for Governor against a very worthy opponent lifted him from 5 points down to a 70% to 30% victory! Two very good and talented men in a great race but congratulations to Brian!

Tweet: Great to be back on track with the European Union. This was a big day for free and fair trade!

Tweet: European Union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately. Also they will be buying vast amounts of LNG!

Tweet: This is great - on my way see you soon @IAGovernor Kim Reynolds!

Tweet: The United States will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long time detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson a great Christian family man and wonderful human being. He is suffering greatly. This innocent man of faith should be released immediately!

Tweet: PROMISES KEPT!

Tweet: America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS and U.S. Steel is back!

Tweet: The Remains of American Servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the United States! After so many years this will be a great moment for so many families. Thank you to Kim Jong Un.

Tweet: The @USNavy’s first female Admiral Alene Duerk once said: “It was a nice distinction to have and to be recognized as the first but I wanted to make certain that I used that notoriety to do as much positive as I could.” Alene did just that and America is forever grateful!

Tweet: Private business investment has surged from 1.8 percent the year BEFORE I came into office to 9.4 percent this year -- that means JOBS JOBS JOBS!

Tweet: Congressman David Kustoff has been a champion for the Trump Agenda - I greatly appreciate his support. David is strong on crime and borders loves our Military Vets and Second Amendment. Get out and vote for David on Thursday August 2nd. He has my full and total Endorsement!

Tweet: Democrats who want Open Borders and care little about Crime are incompetent but they have the Fake News Media almost totally on their side!

Tweet: The only things the Democrats do well is “Resist” which is their campaign slogan and “Obstruct.” Cryin’ Chuck Schumer has almost 400 great American people that are waiting “forever” to serve our Country! A total disgrace. Mitch M should not let them go home until all approved!

Tweet: Join me in Tampa Florida next Tuesday July 31st at 7:00pmE for a #MAGA Rally! Tickets:

Tweet: Tom Homan fmr ICE Director: “There is nobody that has done more for border security &amp; public safety than President Trump. I’ve worked for six presidents and I respect them all but nobody has done more than this Administration &amp; President Trump that’s just a stone cold fact!”

Tweet: Wow highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party. That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. There must be something wrong please recheck that poll!

Tweet: Do you think the Fake News Media will ever report on this tweet from Michael?

Tweet: Please understand there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes. Congress must act on fixing the DUMBEST &amp; WORST immigration laws anywhere in the world! Vote “R”

Tweet: Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G. Sulzberger Publisher of the New York Times. Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media &amp; how that Fake News has morphed into phrase “Enemy of the People.” Sad!

Tweet: The biggest and best results coming out of the good GDP report was that the quarterly Trade Deficit has been reduced by $52 Billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for African Americans Hispanics Asians and Women.

Tweet: I would be willing to “shut down” government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery Catch &amp; Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!

Tweet: There is No Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt headed now by 17 (increased from 13 including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats was started by a fraudulent Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!

Tweet: We must have Border Security get rid of Chain Lottery Catch &amp; Release Sanctuary Cities - go to Merit based Immigration. Protect ICE and Law Enforcement and of course keep building but much faster THE WALL!

Tweet: One of the reasons we need Great Border Security is that Mexico’s murder rate in 2017 increased by 27% to 31174 people killed a record! The Democrats want Open Borders. I want Maximum Border Security and respect for ICE and our great Law Enforcement Professionals! @FoxNews

Tweet: Collusion is not a crime but that doesn’t matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)!

Tweet: I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA doesn’t seem to make much sense!

Tweet: Will be in Tampa tonight. A big year for @RepDeSantis who will be a great governor for Florida. Strong on Crime Borders and our 2nd Amendment. Big help on Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts. Loves our Military &amp; our Vets. Has my Full &amp; Total Endorsement!

Tweet: On my way to Tampa Florida. Look forward to seeing everyone soon!

Tweet: Thank you Florida. I love

Tweet: Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn’t government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!

Tweet: Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign one of the most successful in history is a TOTAL HOAX. The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was along with Comey McCabe Strzok and his lover the lovely Lisa Page used to begin the Witch Hunt. Disgraceful!

Tweet: “We already have a smocking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was Hillary Clinton. How is it OK for Hillary Clinton to proactively seek dirt from the Russians but the Trump campaign met at the Russians request and that is bad?” Marc Thiessen Washington Post

Tweet: Looking back on history who was treated worse Alfonse Capone legendary mob boss killer and “Public Enemy Number One” or Paul Manafort political operative &amp; Reagan/Dole darling now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?

Tweet: “We already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was Hillary Clinton. How is it OK for Hillary Clinton to proactively seek dirt from the Russians but the Trump campaign met at the Russians request and that is bad?” Marc Thiessen Washington Post

Tweet: Charles Koch of Koch Brothers who claims to be giving away millions of dollars to politicians even though I know very few who have seen this (?) now makes the ridiculous statement that what President Trump is doing is unfair to “foreign workers.” He is correct AMERICA FIRST!

Tweet: Wow @foxandfriends is blowing away the competition in the morning ratings. Morning Joe is a dead show with very few people watching and sadly Fake News CNN is also doing poorly. Too much hate and inaccurately reported stories - too predictable!

Tweet: Working hard thank you!

Tweet: Congressman Steve Stivers of Ohio has done a fantastic job as Chairman of the @NRCC.

Tweet: Thank you Ohio. I love you!

Tweet: The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it’s TRUE. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People. They purposely cause great division &amp; distrust. They can also cause War! They are very dangerous &amp; sick!

Tweet: Fake News reporting a complete fabrication that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son Donald had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!

Tweet: Too bad a large portion of the Media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the Rigged Witch Hunt - but that is why we call them FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: Presidential Approval numbers are very good - strong economy military and just about everything else. Better numbers than Obama at this point by far. We are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a Blue Wave but there might be a Red Wave!

Tweet: California wildfires are being magnified &amp; made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!

Tweet: Governor Jerry Brown must allow the Free Flow of the vast amounts of water coming from the North and foolishly being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Can be used for fires farming and everything else. Think of California with plenty of Water - Nice! Fast Federal govt. approvals.

Tweet: When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson he was down in early voting 64 to 36. That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night there was a big turn for the better. Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov.

Tweet: Congratulations to a future STAR of the Republican Party future Senator John James. A big and bold victory tonight in the Great State of Michigan - the first of many. November can’t come fast enough!

Tweet: Congratulations to Josh Hawley on your big Senate Primary win in Missouri. I look forward to working with you toward a big win in November. We need you in Washington!

Tweet: 5 for 5!

Tweet: The Republicans have now won 8 out of 9 House Seats yet if you listen to the Fake News Media you would think we are being clobbered. Why can’t they play it straight so unfair to the Republican Party and in particular your favorite President!

Tweet: As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason) they will win! I LOVE the people &amp; they certainly seem to like the job I’m doing. If I find the time in between China Iran the Economy and much more which I must we will have a giant Red Wave!

Tweet: Congratulations to @LenaEpstein of Michigan on a job well done. Also thanks for your great support!

Tweet: RED WAVE!

Tweet: “There has been no evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election. In fact the evidence is the opposite that Hillary Clinton &amp; the Democrats colluded with the Russians to fix the 2016 election.” @GrahamLedger

Tweet: This is an illegally brought Rigged Witch Hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted. It was started and paid for by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. Phony Dossier FISA disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired. 17 Angry Dems? Stay tuned!

Tweet: Space Force all the way!

Tweet: Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida is doing a fantastic job and has my complete and total Endorsement! Tough on Crime and Borders Ted was really helpful on Tax Cuts. Vote all the way for Ted in the upcoming Primary - he will never let you down!

Tweet: @LindseyGrahamSC “Why didn’t the FBI tell President Trump that they had concerns about Carter Page? Is there a double standard here?” They told Senator Diane Feinstein that she had a spy - but not Trump. Is that entrapment or did they just want to use Page as an excuse to SPY?

Tweet: Jenna Ellis “FBI thought they wouldn’t get caught because they thought that Hillary was going to win. There is overt bias and that depends on whether you are Democrat or Republican - a double standard that needs to stop.”

Tweet: .@MariaBartiromo “No evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians - and here we are a year and a half later.”

Tweet: I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency the Turkish Lira slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!

Tweet: Democrats please do not distance yourselves from Nancy Pelosi. She is a wonderful person whose ideas &amp; policies may be bad but who should definitely be given a 4th chance. She is trying very hard &amp; has every right to take down the Democrat Party if she has veered too far left!

Tweet: Had a very good phone call with @EmmanuelMacron President of France. Discussed various subjects in particular Security and Trade. Many other calls and conversations today. Looking forward to dinner tonight with Tim Cook of Apple. He is investing big dollars in U.S.A.

Tweet: Thank you to Kanye West and the fact that he is willing to tell the TRUTH. One new and great FACT - African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in the history of our Country. So honored by this. Thank you Kanye for your support. It is making a big difference!

Tweet: Deal with Mexico is coming along nicely. Autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal. New President of Mexico has been an absolute gentleman. Canada must wait. Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can’t make a deal!

Tweet: The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division. We must come together as a nation. I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans!

Tweet: I am proud to have fought for and secured the LOWEST African American and Hispanic unemployment rates in history. Now I’m pushing for prison reform to give people who have paid their debt to society a second chance. I will never stop fighting for ALL Americans!

Tweet: Hundreds of Bikers for Trump just joined me at Bedminster. Quite a scene - great people who truly love our Country!

Tweet: Bikers for Trump at Bedminster earlier today. Thank you!

Tweet: .@JudgeJeanine “Bob Mueller isn’t your whole investigation premised on a Fake Dossier paid for by Hillary created by a man who hates Donald Trump &amp; used to con a FISA Court Judge. Bob I really think it’s time for you to give up your phony investigation.” No Collusion!

Tweet: .@GovMikeHuckabee “Your paycheck is bigger your pension is stronger.” @foxandfriends Unemployment numbers are better than they have been in 50 years &amp; perhaps ever. Our country is booming like never before - and it will get even better! Many companies moving back to the U.S.A.

Tweet: Many @harleydavidson owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas. Great! Most other companies are coming in our direction including Harley competitors. A really bad move! U.S. will soon have a level playing field or better.

Tweet: “Seems like the Department of Justice (and FBI) had a program to keep Donald Trump from becoming President”. @DarrellIssa @foxandfriends If this had happened to the other side everybody involved would be in jail. This is a Media coverup of the biggest story of our time.

Tweet: While I know it’s “not presidential” to take on a lowlife like Omarosa and while I would rather not be doing so this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible. Sorry!

Tweet: The very unpopular Governor of Ohio (and failed presidential candidate) @JohnKasich hurt Troy Balderson’s recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate. Even Kasich’s Lt. Governor lost Gov. race because of his unpopularity. Credit to Troy on the BIG WIN!

Tweet: Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI &amp; DOJ gets longer &amp; longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion No Obstruction - I just fight back!

Tweet: Just fired Agent Strzok formerly of the FBI was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation. It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!

Tweet: Wacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non-Disclosure Agreement!

Tweet: Brooks Koepka just won his third Golf Major and he did it not only with his powerful game but with his powerful mind. He has been a man of steel on the Tour and will have many Victories including Majors ahead of him. Congrats to Brooks and his great team on a job well done!

Tweet: Just landed at Fort Drum New York. Looking forward to making a speech about our GREAT HEROES!

Tweet: Great to be in Fort Drum New York with our HEROES!

Tweet: It was my great honor to sign our new Defense Bill into law and to pay tribute to the greatest soldiers in the history of the world: THE U.S. ARMY. The National Defense Authorization Act is the most significant investment in our Military and our warfighters in modern history!

Tweet: “Trump’s foreign policy is actually boosting America’s standing”

Tweet: Scott Walker of Wisconsin is a tremendous Governor who has done incredible things for that Great State. He has my complete &amp; total Endorsement! He brought the amazing Foxconn to Wisconsin with its 15000 Jobs-and so much more. Vote for Scott on Tuesday in the Republican Primary!

Tweet: Lou Dobbs: “This cannot go forward...this Special Councel with all of his conflicts with his 17 Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia. The Dems are the ones who should be investigated.” Thank you Lou so true!

Tweet: When you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the White House I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!

Tweet: Another terrorist attack in London...These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength!

Tweet: Bruce Ohr of the “Justice” Department (can you believe he is still there) is accused of helping disgraced Christopher Steele “find dirt on Trump.” Ohr’s wife Nelly was in on the act big time - worked for Fusion GPS on Fake Dossier. @foxandfriends

Tweet: “They were all in on it clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didn’t do.” Gregg Jarrett on @foxandfriends If we had a real Attorney General this Witch Hunt would never have been started! Looking at the wrong people.

Tweet: Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia and everybody including the Democrats know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary the Democrats and the DNC!

Tweet: Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt - why isn’t this so-called “probe” ended immediately? Why aren’t these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary?

Tweet: Lou Dobbs: “This cannot go forward...this Special Counsel with all of his conflicts with his 17 Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia. The Dems are the ones who should be investigated.” Thank you Lou so true!

Tweet: .@PeteStauber won big last night in Minnesota. A big star in Hockey he will be an even bigger star in politics. It all begins with a win in November. Pete has my complete and total Endorsement!

Tweet: It is about time that Connecticut had a real and talented Governor. Bob Stefanowski is the person needed to do the job. Tough on crime Bob is also a big cutter of Taxes. He will win in November and make a Great Governor a major difference maker. Bob has my total Endorsement!

Tweet: My friend and very early supporter Kris Kobach won the Republican Nomination for Governor of Kansas last night in a tough race against a very fine opponent. Kris will win in November and be a great Governor. He has my complete and total Endorsement!

Tweet: The Rigged Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on as the “originators and founders” of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. All credibility is gone from this terrible Hoax and much more will be lost as it proceeds. No Collusion!

Tweet: “The action (the Strzok firing) was a decisive step in the right direction in correcting the wrongs committed by what has been described as Comey’s skinny inner circle.” Chris Swecker former FBI Assistant Director.

Tweet: Happy Birthday to the leader of the Democrat Party Maxine Waters!

Tweet: Our Country was built on Tariffs and Tariffs are now leading us to great new Trade Deals - as opposed to the horrible and unfair Trade Deals that I inherited as your President. Other Countries should not be allowed to come in and steal the wealth of our great U.S.A. No longer!

Tweet: Chuck Schumer I agree!

Tweet: “John Brennan is a stain on the Country we deserve better than this.” Former Secret Service Agent and author of new book “Spygate the Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump” Dan Bongino. Thank you Dan and good luck with the book!

Tweet: “Hillary Clinton clearly got a pass by the FBI. We have the unfortunate situation where they then decided they were going to frame Donald Trump” concerning the Rigged Witch Hunt. JOE DIGENOVA former U.S. Attorney.

Tweet: “WE’RE NOT GONG TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT.” Can you believe this is the Governor of the Highest Taxed State in the U.S. Andrew Cuomo having a total meltdown!

Tweet: “WE’RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT.” Can you believe this is the Governor of the Highest Taxed State in the U.S. Andrew Cuomo having a total meltdown!

Tweet: Mark Levin “When they had power they didn’t stop the Russians the Chinese the North Koreans they funded the Iranians &amp; are responsible for the greatest scandal in American history by interfering with our election &amp; trying to undermine the Trump Campaign and Trump Presidency.”

Tweet: “I’d strip the whole bunch of them. They’re all corrupt. They’ve all abused their power. They’ve all betrayed the American people with a political agenda. They tried to steal and influence an election in the United States.” @seanhannity

Tweet: Our Economy is doing better than ever. Money is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before companies earnings are higher than ever inflation is low &amp; business optimism is higher than it has ever been. For the first time in many decades we are protecting our workers!

Tweet: THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY. It is very bad for our Great Country....BUT WE ARE WINNING!

Tweet: The Boston Globe which was sold to the the Failing New York Times for 1.3 BILLION DOLLARS (plus 800 million dollars in losses &amp; investment) or 2.1 BILLION DOLLARS was then sold by the Times for 1 DOLLAR. Now the Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press. PROVE IT!

Tweet: There is nothing that I would want more for our Country than true FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. The fact is that the Press is FREE to write and say anything it wants but much of what it says is FAKE NEWS pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people. HONESTY WINS!

Tweet: The Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin is dead. She was a great woman with a wonderful gift from God her voice. She will be missed!

Tweet: Great @Cabinet meeting today at the @WhiteHouse!

Tweet: Thank you for the kind words Omarosa!

Tweet: Turkey has taken advantage of the United States for many years. They are now holding our wonderful Christian Pastor who I must now ask to represent our Country as a great patriot hostage. We will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man but we are cutting back on Turkey!

Tweet: “The FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr (of the Justice Department &amp; whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS).” Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok. This is too crazy to be believed! The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility.

Tweet: “While Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch.” Catherine Herridge of @FoxNews @LouDobbs In other words they were colluding with Russia!

Tweet: “Very concerned about Comey’s firing afraid they will be exposed” said Bruce Ohr. DOJ’s Emails &amp; Notes show Bruce Ohr’s connection to (phony &amp; discredited) Trump Dossier. A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act. Rigged Witch Hunt!

Tweet: .@TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan: “How did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place?” Now that is a really good question! Then followed by “Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero...” So true a total Fake!

Tweet: How can “Senator” Richard Blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam) pass judgement on anyone? Loser!

Tweet: “....An incredibly corrupt FBI &amp; DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election. Brennan has gone off the deep end he’s disgraced and discredited himself. His conduct has been outrageous.” Chris Farrell Judicial Watch.

Tweet: In speaking with some of the world’s top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the U.S. “Stop quarterly reporting &amp; go to a six month system” said one. That would allow greater flexibility &amp; save money. I have asked the SEC to study!

Tweet: How does a politician Cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the U.S. survive making the statement WE’RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT? Which section of the sentence is worse?

Tweet: Just announced youth unemployment is at a 50 year low! @foxandfriends

Tweet: The U.S. has more than double the growth rate than it had 18 months ago.

Tweet: Wow! Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America’s lack of greatness. I have already MADE America Great Again just look at the markets jobs military- setting records and we will do even better. Andrew “chocked” badly mistake!

Tweet: Wow! Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America’s lack of greatness. I have already MADE America Great Again just look at the markets jobs military- setting records and we will do even better. Andrew “choked” badly mistake!

Tweet: When a politician admits that “We’re not going to make America great again” there doesn’t seem to be much reason to ever vote for him. This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother Chris!

Tweet: “Fox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti-Trump Russia probe will be exposed.” Charles Payne @FoxBusiness How much more does Mueller have to see? They have blinders on - RIGGED!

Tweet: All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction China. But in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone!

Tweet: Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history &amp; since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!

Tweet: Great Job Rachel Campos-Duffy on @foxandfriends.

Tweet: The Economy is stronger and better than ever before. Importantly there remains tremendous potential - it will only get better with time!

Tweet: The United States has ended the ridiculous 230 Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria. Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the U.S. I want to develop the U.S. our military and countries that help us!

Tweet: I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Councel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion No Obstruction. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion No Obstruction. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: No Collusion and No Obstruction except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. All of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction. What about the Brennan Comey McCabe Strzok lies to Congress or Crooked’s Emails!

Tweet: The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President when in fact it is just the opposite - &amp; the two Fake reporters knew this. This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People. So bad for America!

Tweet: Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times. They actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward. From the day I announced the Times has been Fake News and with their disgusting new Board Member it will only get worse!

Tweet: Study the late Joseph McCarthy because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby! Rigged Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Where’s the Collusion? They made up a phony crime called Collusion and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt they scream Obstruction!

Tweet: I hope John Brennan the worst CIA Director in our country’s history brings a lawsuit. It will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt. He won’t sue!

Tweet: Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance it’s worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan. It certainly isn’t because of the good job he did! He is a political “hack.”

Tweet: Will Bruce Ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited Dossier ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions “Justice” Department? A total joke!

Tweet: “Bruce Ohr is at the center of FALSE ALLEGATIONS which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didn’t happen.” Darrell Issa House Oversight. We can take out the word “apparently.” @FoxNews

Tweet: It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the U.S. Postal System from China. We can and must END THIS NOW! The Senate should pass the STOP ACT – and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. No more delay!

Tweet: .@DianeHarkey is an extraordinary woman of great accomplishment &amp; potential. She is running as a very popular Republican for the Congressional seat of my friend Darrell Issa-with his complete support. Diane is strong on crime loves our Military &amp; Vets-has my total Endorsement!

Tweet: Just watched former Intelligence Official Phillip Mudd become totally unglued and weird while debating wonderful @PARISDENNARD over Brennan’s Security Clearance. Dennard destroyed him but Mudd is in no mental condition to have such a Clearance. Should be REVOKED? @seanhannity

Tweet: Will be going to the Great State of West Virginia on Tuesday Night to campaign &amp; do a Rally Speech for a hard working and spectacular person A.G. Patrick Morrisey who is running for the U.S. Senate. Patrick has great Energy &amp; Stamina-I need his VOTE to MAGA. Total Endorsement!

Tweet: I am hearing so many great things about the Republican Party’s California Gubernatorial Candidate John Cox. He is a very successful businessman who is tired of high Taxes &amp; Crime. He will Make California Great Again &amp; make you proud of your Great State again. Total Endorsement!

Tweet: A Blue Wave means Crime and Open Borders. A Red Wave means Safety and Strength!

Tweet: Even James Clapper has admonished John Brennan for having gone totally off the rails. Maybe Clapper is being nice to me so he doesn’t lose his Security Clearance for lying to Congress!

Tweet: Fake News of which there is soooo much (this time the very tired New Yorker) falsely reported that I was going to take the extraordinary step of denying Intelligence Briefings to President Obama. Never discussed or thought of!

Tweet: I am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the Border into the United States ILLEGALLY! If there were no serious consequences our country would be overrun with people trying to get in and our system could not handle it!

Tweet: Big Rally tonight in West Virginia. Patrick Morrisey is running a GREAT race for U.S. Senate. I have done so much for West Virginia against all odds and having Patrick a real fighter by my side would make things so much easier. See you later. CLEAN COAL!!!!

Tweet: Bill DeBlasio the high taxing Mayor of NYC just stole my campaign slogan: PROMISES MADE PROMISES KEPT! That’s not at all nice. No imagination! @foxandfriends

Tweet: To the incredible people of the Great State of Wyoming: Go VOTE TODAY for Foster Friess - He will be a fantastic Governor! Strong on Crime Borders &amp; 2nd Amendment. Loves our Military &amp; our Vets. He has my complete and total Endorsement!

Tweet: MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Thank you West Virginia. I love you!

Tweet: If anyone is looking for a good lawyer I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!

Tweet: I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. “Justice” took a 12 year old tax case among other things applied tremendous pressure on him and unlike Michael Cohen he refused to “break” - make up stories in order to get a “deal.” Such respect for a brave man!

Tweet: A large number of counts ten could not even be decided in the Paul Manafort case. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!

Tweet: Thank you to Democrat Assemblyman Dov Hikind of New York for your very gracious remarks on @foxandfriends for our deporting a longtime resident Nazi back to Germany! Others worked on this for decades.

Tweet: Everyone in the path of #HurricaneLane please prepare yourselves heed the advice of State and local officials and follow @NWSHonolulu for updates. Be safe!

Tweet: Longest bull run in the history of the stock market congratulations America!

Tweet: I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends by @ainsleyearhardt tomorrow from 6:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M. Enjoy!

Tweet: The only thing that I have done wrong is to win an election that was expected to be won by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. The problem is they forgot to campaign in numerous states!

Tweet: I have asked Secretary of State @MikePompeo4USA to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews

Tweet: I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews

Tweet: NO COLLUSION - RIGGED WITCH HUNT!

Tweet: It was my great honor to host the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act Roundtable today at the @WhiteHouse!

Tweet: I have authorized an emergency disaster declaration to provide Hawaii the necessary support ahead of #HurricaneLane. Our teams are closely coordinating with the state and local authorities. You are in our thoughts!

Tweet: Target CEO raves about the Economy. “This is the best consumer environment I’ve seen in my career.” A big statement from a top executive. But virtually everybody is saying this &amp; when our Trade Deals are made &amp; cost cutting done you haven’t seen anything yet! @DRUDGE_REPORT

Tweet: Our Economy is setting records on virtually every front - Probably the best our country has ever done. Tremendous value created since the Election. The World is respecting us again! Companies are moving back to the U.S.A.

Tweet: Ex-NSA contractor to spend 63 months in jail over “classified” information. Gee this is “small potatoes” compared to what Hillary Clinton did! So unfair Jeff Double Standard.

Tweet: Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people. Can’t do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real and what is not without censorship!

Tweet: Thank you. I love you Ohio!

Tweet: I spoke with Governor David Ige of Hawaii today to express our full support for the people of Hawaii as the State is impacted by #HurricaneLane. The Federal Government is fully committed to helping the people of Hawaii.

Tweet: Congratulations to new Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. There are no greater friends than the United States and Australia!

Tweet: Great #StateDinner2018 in Ohio tonight! Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Happy birthday Vince you are truly one of the greats!

Tweet: Michaels Cohen’s attorney clarified the record saying his client does not know if President Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting (out of which came nothing!). The answer is that I did NOT know about the meeting. Just another phony story by the Fake News Media!

Tweet: Jeff Sessions said he wouldn’t allow politics to influence him only because he doesn’t understand what is happening underneath his command position. Highly conflicted Bob Mueller and his gang of 17 Angry Dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched. No Collusion!

Tweet: .@LindseyGrahamSC “Every President deserves an Attorney General they have confidence in. I believe every President has a right to their Cabinet these are not lifetime appointments. You serve at the pleasure of the President.”

Tweet: Big story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails many of which are REALLY BAD. Also gave false election info. I feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption. At some point I may have to get involved!

Tweet: “The FBI only looked at 3000 of 675000 Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails.” They purposely didn’t look at the disasters. This news is just out. @FoxNews

Tweet: “The FBI looked at less than 1%” of Crooked’s Emails!

Tweet: Fantastic numbers on consumer spending released on Friday. Stock Market hits all time high!

Tweet: “Mainstream Media tries to rewrite history to credit Obama for Trump accomplishments. Since President Trump took office the economy is booming. The stronger the economy gets the more desperate his critics are. O had weakest recovery since Great Depression.” @WashTimes

Tweet: Over 90% approval rating for your all time favorite (I hope) President within the Republican Party and 52% overall. This despite all of the made up stories by the Fake News Media trying endlessly to make me look as bad and evil as possible. Look at the real villains please!

Tweet: Thank you to the great @JimBrownNFL32 perhaps the greatest running back of all time for your wonderful words and support. Since our meeting in New York African-American UNEMPLOYMENT has reached the LOWEST LEVEL IN HISTORY. You get it!

Tweet: The Fake News Media worked hard to get Tiger Woods to say something that he didn’t want to say. Tiger wouldn’t play the game - he is very smart. More importantly he is playing great golf again!

Tweet: A big deal looking good with Mexico!

Tweet: Rick Scott of Florida is doing a fantastic job as Governor. Jobs are pouring into the State and its economic health is better than ever before. He is strong on Crime Borders and loves our Military and Vets. Vote for Rick on Tuesday!

Tweet: NASDAQ has just gone above 8000 for the first time in history!

Tweet: I smile at Senators and others talking about how good free trade is for the U.S. What they don’t say is that we lose Jobs and over 800 Billion Dollars a year on really dumb Trade Deals....and these same countries Tariff us to death. These lawmakers are just fine with this!

Tweet: “Consumer confidence pops in August to highest level since October 2000”

Tweet: Such a fantastic win for Ron DeSantis and the people of the Great State of Florida. Ron will be a fantastic Governor. On to November!

Tweet: Congratulations to Governor Rick Scott of Florida on his conclusive Republican Primary Win. He will be a great Senator!

Tweet: What’s going on at @CNN is happening to different degrees at other networks - with @NBCNews being the worst. The good news is that Andy Lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence and much worse. When Lester Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia they were hurt badly!

Tweet: Beto O’Rourke is a total lightweight compared to Ted Cruz and he comes nowhere near representing the values and desires of the people of the Great State of Texas. He will never be allowed to turn Texas into Venezuela!

Tweet: #JobsNotMobs!

Tweet: This is what it is all about for the Republican Party! #JobsNotMobs

Tweet: WOW - Mesa Arizona! Look forward to joining everyone soon. Something’s happening!! #MAGA🇺🇸

Tweet: Beautiful evening in Mesa Arizona with GREAT PATRIOTS - thank you! #MAGARally🇺🇸replay:

Tweet: If the Democrats would stop being obstructionists and come together we could write up and agree to new immigration laws in less than one hour. Look at the needless pain and suffering that they are causing. Look at the horrors taking place on the Border. Chuck &amp; Nancy call me!

Tweet: Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be a great governor. He has been successful at whatever he has done and has prepared for this very difficult and complex job for many years. He has my Strong Endorsement. His opponent is totally unqualified. Would destroy a great state!

Tweet: Get out and Early Vote for Brian Kemp. He will be a GREAT GOVERNOR for the State of Georgia!

Tweet: Ron @RonDeSantisFL DeSantis is working hard. A great Congressman and top student at Harvard &amp; Yale Ron will be a record setting governor for Florida. Rick Scott gave him tremendous foundations to further build on. His opponent runs one of the worst &amp; most corrupt cities in USA!

Tweet: Rick Scott is known as easily one of the best Governors in the USA. Florida is setting records in almost every category of success. Amazing achievement-the envy of the World. Ron DeSantis will build on this success. His incompetent opponent will destroy Florida - next Venezuela!

Tweet: Leaving Arizona after a fantastic Rally last night in Mesa honoring and for Martha @RepMcSally McSally. She is an inspiration &amp; will be a GREAT SENATOR for the people of Arizona. Her opponent is a Nancy Pelosi puppet really bad for State. Early Voting NOW! Will be back soon.

Tweet: Heading to Nevada to help a man who has become a good friend Senator Dean Heller. He is all about #MAGA and I need his Help and Talent in Washington. Also Adam Laxalt will be a GREAT GOVERNOR and has my complete and total Endorsement. Winners Both!

Tweet: Watched North Dakota’s Rep. Kevin Cramer easily win debate with Senator Heidi Heitkamp. Great job Kevin you will be a great Senator!

Tweet: Full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our Souther Border. People have to apply for asylum in Mexico first and if they fail to do that the U.S. will turn them away. The courts are asking the U.S. to do things that are not doable!

Tweet: The Caravans are a disgrace to the Democrat Party. Change the immigration laws NOW!

Tweet: Best Jobs Numbers in the history of our great Country! Many other things likewise. So why wouldn’t we win the Midterms? Dems can never do even nearly as well! Think of what will happen to your now beautiful 401-k’s!

Tweet: Facebook has just stated that they are setting up a system to “purge” themselves of Fake News. Does that mean CNN will finally be put out of business?

Tweet: Ron @RonDeSantisFL DeSantis had a great debate victory tonight against Andrew Gillum a mayor who presides over one of the worst run and most corrupt cities in Florida. Ron will build on the great job done by Governor Rick Scott. Gillum will make Florida the next Venezuela!

Tweet: Congressman Tom Reed of New York’s 23rd District has done a great job. He has my complete and total Endorsement!

Tweet: Sadly it looks like Mexico’s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy. Must change laws!

Tweet: Every time you see a Caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our Country illegally think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws! Remember the Midterms! So unfair to those who come in legally.

Tweet: Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.

Tweet: Big Night In Texas!!!!

Tweet: At stake in this Election is whether we continue the extraordinary prosperity we have achieved - or whether we let the Radical Democrat Mob take a giant wrecking ball to our Country and our Economy! #JobsNotMobs

Tweet: Today’s Democrat Party would rather protect criminal aliens than AMERICAN CITIZENS - which is why the Democrats must be voted OUT of OFFICE! #JobsNotMobs

Tweet: We send our deepest condolences to @RepLouBarletta and the entire Barletta family on the passing of his brother. Lou has been working so hard despite this terrible situation for the people of Pennsylvania. Our thoughts and prayers are with Lou and the entire Barletta family!

Tweet: Jay Webber of New Jersey running for Congress is doing a great job against a person who is looking to raise Taxes substantially. Jay wants big Tax Cuts and Changes. A Harvard graduate and father of seven Jay will be great for New Jersey and get the job done-and I will help!

Tweet: The people of Puerto Rico are wonderful but the inept politicians are trying to use the massive and ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations. The U.S. will NOT bail out long outstanding &amp; unpaid obligations with hurricane relief money!

Tweet: Congressman John Faso of New York has worked hard and smart. Strong on Crime Borders and our 2nd Amendment John is respected by all. Vote for John. He has my complete and total Endorsement!

Tweet: #JobsNotMobs

Tweet: Billions of dollars are and will be coming into United States coffers because of Tariffs. Great also for negotiations - if a country won’t give us a fair Trade Deal we will institute Tariffs on them. Used or not jobs and businesses will be created. U.S. respected again!

Tweet: I agree with President Obama 100%!

Tweet: For those who want and advocate for illegal immigration just take a good look at what has happened to Europe over the last 5 years. A total mess! They only wish they had that decision to make over again.

Tweet: We are a great Sovereign Nation. We have Strong Borders and will never accept people coming into our Country illegally!

Tweet: The so-called experts on Trump over at the New York Times wrote a long and boring article on my cellphone usage that is so incorrect I do not have time here to correct it. I only use Government Phones and have only one seldom used government cell phone. Story is soooo wrong!

Tweet: Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council is right when he says on @foxandfriends that the Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the Border. MUST BE CHANDED but I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency. They will be stopped!

Tweet: A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News. It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act FAST!

Tweet: The New York Times has a new Fake Story that now the Russians and Chinese (glad they finally added China) are listening to all of my calls on cellphones. Except that I rarely use a cellphone &amp; when I do it’s government authorized. I like Hard Lines. Just more made up Fake News!

Tweet: “Remarks by President Trump on a Year of Historic Progress and Action to Combat the Opioid Crisis”

Tweet: Funny how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream “it’s just not Presidential!”

Tweet: The United States has been spending Billions of Dollars a year on Illegal Immigration. This will not continue. Democrats must give us the votes to pass strong (but fair) laws. If not we will be forced to play a much tougher hand.

Tweet: Twitter has removed many people from my account and more importantly they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all. A few weeks ago it was a Rocket Ship now it is a Blimp! Total Bias?

Tweet: Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this “Bomb” stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics. Very unfortunate what is going on. Republicans go out and vote!

Tweet: I will be speaking at the Young Black Leadership Summit in 15 minutes where I will address the investigation into the bomb packages.

Tweet: I would like to begin today’s remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been mailed to high-profile figures throughout our Country and a media org. I am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody.

Tweet: I want to applaud the FBI Secret Service Department of Justice the U.S. Attorneys’ Office for the Southern District of New York the NYPD and all Law Enforcement partners across the Country for their incredible work skill and determination!

Tweet: Whether you are African-American Hispanic-American or ANY AMERICAN at all – you have the right to live in a Country that puts YOUR NEEDS FIRST!

Tweet: It was my great honor thank you!

Tweet: If you meet every day with optimism – if you confront every obstacle with determination – if you refuse to give up if you never quit if you face every challenge with confidence and pride – then there is no goal you cannot achieve and no dream beyond your reach! #YBLS2018

Tweet: Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought. Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been and will be with them all the way. I will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at Future Farmers of America.

Tweet: Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose &amp; dominating through almost 7 innings Rich Hill of Dodgers and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time big mistake!

Tweet: Very interesting!

Tweet: Thank you to Steve Rogers FBI Joint Terror Task Force (Ret) for his very kind and generous remarks about me and my relationship to Law Enforcement. @JudgeJeanine

Tweet: Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer who I have not seen in action before be interviewed by @jaketapper. He comes off as a crazed &amp; stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon. As bad as their field is if he is running for President the Dems will eat him alive!

Tweet: The Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country. Actually it is their Fake &amp; Dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand!

Tweet: Had a very good conversation with the newly elected President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro who won his race by a substantial margin. We agreed that Brazil and the United States will work closely together on Trade Military and everything else! Excellent call wished him congrats!

Tweet: Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border. Please go back you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!

Tweet: In Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country!

Tweet: Great job being done by Congressman Keith Rothfus of Pennsylvania. Thank you Keith!

Tweet: CNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the “Media is the Enemy of the People.” Wrong! I said that the “Fake News (Media) is the Enemy of the People” a very big difference. When you give out false information - not good!

Tweet: Check out tweets from last two days. I refer to Fake News Media when mentioning Enemy of the People - but dishonest reporters use only the word “Media.” The people of our Great Country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much Fake News. They get it and fully understand!

Tweet: I will be interviewed by Laura Ingraham tonight at 10:00 P.M. on @FoxNews

Tweet: Harry Reid when he was sane agreed with us on Birthright Citizenship!

Tweet: Yesterday in Pittsburgh I was really impressed with Congressman Keith Rothfus (far more so than any other local political figure). His sincere level of compassion grief and sorrow for the events that took place was in its own way very inspiring. Vote for Keith!

Tweet: Dana Rohrabacher has been a great Congressman for his District and for the people of Cal. He works hard and is respected by all - he produces! Dems are desperate to replace Dana by spending vast sums to elect a super liberal who is weak on Crime and bad for our Military &amp; Vets!

Tweet: There is a rumor put out by the Democrats that Josh Hawley of Missouri left the Arena last night early. It is Fake News. He met me at the plane when I arrived spoke at the great Rally &amp; stayed to the very end. In fact I said goodbye to him and left before he did. Deception!

Tweet: Congressman Peter King of New York is a hardworking gem. Loves his Country and his State. Get out and VOTE for Peter!

Tweet: POLLING LOCATIONS:

Tweet: Bob Hugin successful all of his life would be a Great Senator from New Jersey. He has my complete and total Endorsement! Get out and Vote for Bob.

Tweet: Epstein all the way in Michigan House 11. She is a wonderful person and at the same time a real fighter. Has my Strong Endorsement!

Tweet: Florida very important - get out and vote for Florida Congressional Candidate Michael Waltz (R). He has my Strong Endorsement!

Tweet: Congressman Randy Hultgren (R) of Illinois is doing a great job. Get out and Vote for Randy - Total Endorsement!

Tweet: Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!

Tweet: .@DavidAsmanfox “How do the Democrats respond to this? Think of how his position with Republicans improves-all the candidates who won tonight. They realize how important he is because of what he did in campaigning for them. They owe him their political career.” Thanks I agree!

Tweet: Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out and hoping on Trade Deals. Now we can all get back to work and get things done!

Tweet: Ron DeSantis showed great courage in his hard fought campaign to become the Governor of Florida. Congratulations to Ron and family!

Tweet: Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election embracing certain policies and principles did very well. Those that did not say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!

Tweet: I will be doing a news conference at The White House - 11:30 A.M. Will be discussing our success in the Midterms!

Tweet: To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information and much else at the Senate level. Two can play that game!

Tweet: In all fairness Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor!

Tweet: According to NBC News Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the so-called Mueller Investigation (46%) more than they Approve (41%). You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt led by 17 Angry Democrats is all about!

Tweet: Law Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott!

Tweet: “Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States”

Tweet: .@BrianKempGA ran a great race in Georgia – he won. It is time to move on!

Tweet: You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia – but the Election was on Tuesday? Let’s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!

Tweet: As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer Marc Elias to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don’t worry Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!

Tweet: Jeff Flake(y) doesn’t want to protect the Non-Senate confirmed Special Counsel he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the “crime” of doing a terrible job! A weak and ineffective guy!

Tweet: Rick Scott was up by 50000+ votes on Election Day now they “found” many votes and he is only up 15000 votes. “The Broward Effect.” How come they never find Republican votes?

Tweet: Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him “back into play.” Bill Nelson conceded Election - now he’s back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!

Tweet: In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a “number” couldn’t do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory!

Tweet: Thank you @marcorubio for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties. The WORLD is now watching closely!

Tweet: Just out — in Arizona SIGNATURES DON’T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!

Tweet: President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S. China and Russia. Very insulting but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!

Tweet: There is no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now or no more Fed payments!

Tweet: I am in Paris getting ready to celebrate the end of World War One. Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war in particular that one which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time?

Tweet: Happy 243rd Birthday to our GREAT U.S. Marine Corps🇺🇸

Tweet: Had very productive meetings and calls for our Country today. Meeting tonight with World Leaders!

Tweet: Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!

Tweet: More than 4000 are fighting the Camp and Woolsey Fires in California that have burned over 170000 acres. Our hearts are with those fighting the fires the 52000 who have evacuated and the families of the 11 who have died. The destruction is catastrophic. God Bless them all.

Tweet: These California fires are expanding very very quickly (in some cases 80-100 acres a minute). If people don’t evacuate quickly they risk being overtaken by the fire. Please listen to evacuation orders from State and local officials!

Tweet: With proper Forest Management we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart!

Tweet: On this Veterans Day — the 100th Anniversary of the end of WWI we honor the brave HEROES who fought for America in the Great War and every Veteran who has worn the uniform and kept our Nation Safe Strong and FREE!

Tweet: Beautiful ceremony today in Paris commemorating the end of World War One. Many World leaders in attendance. Thank you to @EmmanuelMacron President of France! Now off to Suresnes American Cemetery to make speech in honor of our great heroes! Then back to the U.S.A.

Tweet: Poland a great country - Congratulations on the 100th Anniversary of your Independence. I will never forget my time there!

Tweet: The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!

Tweet: The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches!

Tweet: The California Fire Fighters FEMA and First Responders are amazing and very brave. Thank you and God Bless you all!

Tweet: American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast. They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws. “These guys are acting much worse and have much more potential for damage to consumers than anything AT&amp;T-Time Warner would do.” Charlie Gasparino

Tweet: Hopefully Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!

Tweet: I just approved an expedited request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of California. Wanted to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on. I am with you all the way. God Bless all of the victims and families affected.

Tweet: Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S. China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One &amp; Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!

Tweet: On Trade France makes excellent wine but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France and charges big Tariffs whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair must change!

Tweet: By the way when the helicopter couldn’t fly to the first cemetery in France because of almost zero visibility I suggested driving. Secret Service said NO too far from airport &amp; big Paris shutdown. Speech next day at American Cemetary in pouring rain! Little reported-Fake News!

Tweet: When will Bill Nelson concede in Florida? The characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to “find” enough votes too much spotlight on them now!

Tweet: The story in the New York Times concerning North Korea developing missile bases is inaccurate. We fully know about the sites being discussed nothing new - and nothing happening out of the normal. Just more Fake News. I will be the first to let you know if things go bad!

Tweet: Today we gathered for Diwali a holiday observed by Buddhists Sikhs and Jains throughout the United States &amp; around the world. Hundreds of millions of people have gathered with family &amp; friends to light the Diya and to mark the beginning of a New Year.

Tweet: Was just briefed by @FEMA_Brock and @SecretaryZinke who are in California. Thank you to the great Firefighters First Responders and @FEMA for the incredible job they are doing w/ the California Wildfires. Our Nation appreciates your heroism courage &amp; genius. God Bless you all!

Tweet: Just spoke to Governor Jerry Brown to let him know that we are with him and the people of California all the way!

Tweet: I am grateful to be here today w/ Members of the House &amp; Senate who have poured their time heart and energy into the crucial issue of Prison Reform. Working together w/ my Admin over the last two years these members have reached a bipartisan

Tweet: Our pledge to hire American includes those leaving prison and looking for a very fresh start — new job and new life. The legislation I am supporting today contains many significant reforms. Read more here:

Tweet: The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good. We are the envy of the world. But anytime I even think about making changes the FAKE NEWS MEDIA goes crazy always seeking to make us look as bad as possible! Very dishonest!

Tweet: Universities will someday study what highly conflicted (and NOT Senate approved) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people. Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary Comey McCabe Lisa Page &amp; her lover Peter S and all of his friends on the other side?

Tweet: The only “Collusion” is that of the Democrats with Russia and many others. Why didn’t the FBI take the Server from the DNC? They still don’t have it. Check out how biased Facebook Google and Twitter are in favor of the Democrats. That’s the real Collusion!

Tweet: .@FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to visit with our GREAT U.S. MARINES at the Marine Barracks here in Washington D.C. We love you @USMC @MBWDC!

Tweet: It was my great honor to host a @WhiteHouse Conference on Supporting Veterans &amp; Military Families...To everyone here today who has served our Country in uniform &amp; to every Veteran &amp; Military family across our land I want to express the eternal gratitude of our entire Nation!

Tweet: People are not being told that the Republican Party is on track to pick up two seats in the U.S. Senate and epic victory: 53 to 47. The Fake News Media only wants to speak of the House were the Midterm results were better than other sitting Presidents.

Tweet: Today in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse it was my true privilege to award seven extraordinary Americans with the Presidential Medal of

Tweet: People are not being told that the Republican Party is on track to pick up two seats in the U.S. Senate and epic victory: 53 to 47. The Fake News Media only wants to speak of the House where the Midterm results were better than other sitting Presidents.

Tweet: PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM

Tweet: Congratulations to Ron DeSantis on becoming the new Governor of Florida. Against all odds he fought &amp; fought &amp; fought the result being a historic victory. He never gave up and never will. He will be a great Governor!

Tweet: Congratulations to Brian Kemp on becoming the new Governor of Georgia. Stacey Abrams fought brilliantly and hard - she will have a terrific political future! Brian was unrelenting and will become a great Governor for the truly Wonderful People of Georgia!

Tweet: Thank you @JerryBrownGov. Look forward to joining you and @GavinNewsom tomorrow in California. We are with you!

Tweet: I can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House. She deserves this victory she has earned it - but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away. She will win! @TomReedCongress

Tweet: Congratulations to Andrew Gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for Governor of the Great State of Florida. He will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future - a force to reckon with!

Tweet: Heading to California with @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy @RepLaMalfa and @KenCalvert. Look forward to being with our brave Firefighters First Responders and @FEMA along with the many brave People of California. We are with you all the way – God Bless you all!

Tweet: Incredible to be with our GREAT HEROES today in California. We will always be with you!

Tweet: I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on @FoxNews at 2:00 P.M. and 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!

Tweet: So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!

Tweet: The Mayor of Tijuana Mexico just stated that “the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants the backlog could last 6 months.” Likewise the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!

Tweet: Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A. often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum will be detained or turned away. Dems must approve Border Security &amp; Wall NOW!

Tweet: From day one Rick Scott never wavered. He was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida. Congratulations to Rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign!

Tweet: .@cindyhydesmith loves Mississippi and our Great U.S.A.

Tweet: The Fake News is showing old footage of people climbing over our Ocean Area Fence. This is what it really looks like - no climbers anymore under our Administration!

Tweet: I hope the discovery and eventual recovery of the Argentine submarine San Juan brings needed closure to the wonderful families of those brave missing sailors. I look forward to hearing more from my friend President @MauricioMacri in Argentina later this month.

Tweet: So-called comedian Michelle Wolf bombed so badly last year at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner that this year for the first time in decades they will have an author instead of a comedian. Good first step in comeback of a dying evening and tradition! Maybe I will go?

Tweet: AMERICA FIRST!

Tweet: Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54 was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia but let’s go lower!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: “‘Trump Imitation Syndrome’ is afflicting the president’s liberal enemies” Thank you @MGoodwin_NYPost!

Tweet: Great new book out “Mad Politics: Keeping Your Sanity in a World Gone Crazy” by @RealDrGina Loudon. Go out and get your copy today — a great read!

Tweet: “Thank you to President Trump on the Border. No American President has ever done this before.” Hector Garza National Border Patrol Council

Tweet: There are a lot of CRIMINALS in the Caravan. We will stop them. Catch and Detain! Judicial Activism by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens is putting our country in great danger. Not good!

Tweet: “79% of these decisions have been overturned in the 9th Circuit.” @FoxNews A terrible costly and dangerous disgrace. It has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays. Much talk over dividing up the 9th Circuit into 2 or 3 Circuits. Too big!

Tweet: Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?

Tweet: You just can’t win with the Fake News Media. A big story today is that because I have pushed so hard and gotten Gasoline Prices so low more people are driving and I have caused traffic jams throughout our Great Nation. Sorry everyone!

Tweet: “It’s a mean &amp; nasty world out there the Middle East in particular. This is a long and historic commitment &amp; one that is absolutely vital to America’s national security.” @SecPompeo I agree 100%. In addition many Billions of Dollars of purchases made in U.S. big Jobs &amp; Oil!

Tweet: HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL!

Tweet: Will be speaking with our great military in different parts of the world through teleconference at 9:00 A.M. Eastern. Then it will be off to see our Coast Guard patriots &amp; to thank them for the great job they have been doing especially with the hurricanes. Happy Thanksgiving!

Tweet: This is the coldest weather in the history of the Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC and one of the coldest Thanksgivings on record!

Tweet: Our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the Border because of the Judicial Activism and Interference by the 9th Circuit. Nevertheless they are working hard to make America a safer place though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins!

Tweet: Republicans and Democrats MUST come together finally with a major Border Security package which will include funding for the Wall. After 40 years of talk it is finally time for action. Fix the Border for once and for all NOW!

Tweet: Really good Criminal Justice Reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support. @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and @senchuckschumer have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country. Already past with big vote in House. Would be a major victory for ALL!

Tweet: I am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by @USTreasury Secretary @StevenMnuchin1. The FAKE NEWS likes to write stories to the contrary quoting phony sources or jealous people but they aren’t true. They never like to ask me for a quote b/c it would kill their story.

Tweet: Victor Davis Hanson was a very good and interesting guest of Mark Levin on @FoxNews. He wrote a highly touted book called “The Second World Wars” and a new book will soon be coming out called “The Case For Trump.” Recommend both. @marklevinshow

Tweet: I will be in Gulfport and Tupelo Mississippi on Monday night doing two Rallies for Senator Hyde-Smith who has a very important Election on Tuesday. She is an outstanding person who is strong on the Border Crime Military our great Vets Healthcare &amp; the 2nd A. Needed in D.C.

Tweet: The large and violent French protests don’t take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection. Both of these topics must be remedied soon.

Tweet: Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S. No longer). Dems created this problem. No crossings!

Tweet: So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T). Add that which is like a big Tax Cut to our other good Economic news. Inflation down (are you listening Fed)!

Tweet: Mississippi Vote for @cindyhydesmith on Tuesday. Respected by all. We need her in Washington!. Thanks!

Tweet: General Anthony Tata: “President Trump is a man of his word &amp; he said he was going to be tough on the Border and he is tough on the Border. He has rightfully strengthened the Border in the face of an unprecedented threat. It’s the right move by President Trump.” Thanks General!

Tweet: Europe has to pay their fair share for Military Protection. The European Union for many years has taken advantage of us on Trade and then they don’t live up to their Military commitment through NATO. Things must change fast!

Tweet: Clinton Foundation donations drop 42% - which shows that they illegally played the power game. They monetized their political influence through the Foundation. “During her tenure the State Department was put in the service of the Clinton Foundation.” Andrew McCarthy

Tweet: Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants many of whom are stone cold criminals back to their countries. Do it by plane do it by bus do it anyway you want but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress fund the WALL!

Tweet: On the ten-year anniversary of the Mumbai terror attack the U.S. stands with the people of India in their quest for justice. The attack killed 166 innocents including six Americans. We will never let terrorists win or even come close to winning!

Tweet: Polls are open in Mississippi. We need Cindy Hyde-Smith in Washington. GO OUT AND VOTE. Thanks!

Tweet: The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace. They are looking at supposedly stolen Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails (even though they don’t want to look at the DNC Server) but have no interest in the Emails that Hillary DELETED &amp; acid washed AFTER getting a Congressional Subpoena!

Tweet: Brenda Snipes in charge of voting in Broward County Florida was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 I VOTED signs on it. Just kidding she is a fine very honorable and highly respected voting tactician!

Tweet: Congratulations to Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith on your big WIN in the Great State of Mississippi. We are all very proud of you!

Tweet: While the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts &amp; they will get relief. This is our Joseph McCarthy Era!

Tweet: Steel Dynamics announced that it will build a brand new 3 million ton steel mill in the Southwest that will create 600 good-paying U.S. JOBS. Steel JOBS are coming back to America just like I predicted. Congratulations to Steel Dynamics!

Tweet: On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania and the entire Trump family I want to wish you all a very MERRY CHRISTMAS! May this Christmas Season bring peace to your hearts warmth to your homes cheer to your spirits and JOY TO THE WORLD! #NCTL2018🎄

Tweet: Sebastian Gorka a very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House has just written an excellent book “Why We Fight.” Much will be learned from this very good read!

Tweet: So much happening with the now discredited Witch Hunt. This total Hoax will be studied for years!

Tweet: General Motors is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing. Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country. Auto companies are pouring into the U.S. including BMW which just announced a major new plant. The U.S.A. is booming!

Tweet: Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime? At the same time Mueller and the Angry Democrats aren’t even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. A total disgrace!

Tweet: When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end-or will it just go on forever? After wasting more than $40000000 (is that possible?) it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia. So Ridiculous!

Tweet: Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the U.S.A. because of the Tariffs being charged to China and there is a long way to go. If companies don’t want to pay Tariffs build in the U.S.A. Otherwise lets just make our Country richer than ever before!

Tweet: .@SteveScalise has written an absolutely fascinating book (BACK IN THE GAME) on the world of D.C. politics and more. He has experienced so much in a short period of time. Few people have had his bravery or courage and he has come all the way back. A big power and great person!

Tweet: .@DBongino’s new book "Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump" is terrific. He's tough he's smart and he really gets it. His book is on sale now I highly recommend!

Tweet: With all of the new books coming out you can't forget two of the great originals written by @GreggJarrett and @JudgeJeanine Pirro. Their books both went to #1. Go get them now the phony Witch Hunt is well explained!

Tweet: We have been working hard on this - and it’s only going to get better!

Tweet: As RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel oversaw history defying gains in the Senate and unprecedented fundraising strength. I have asked her to serve another term for my 2020 re-elect because there is no one better for the job!

Tweet: Just landed in Argentina with @FLOTUS Melania! #G20Summit

Tweet: “This demonstrates the Robert Mueller and his partisans have no evidence not a whiff of collusion between Trump and the Russians. Russian project legal. Trump Tower meeting (son Don) perfectly legal. He wasn’t involved with hacking.” Gregg Jarrett. A total Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Alan Dershowitz: “These are not crimes. He (Mueller) has no authority to be a roving Commissioner. I don’t see any evidence of crimes.” This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately. Mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side. Where is the IG REPORT?

Tweet: Arrived in Argentina with a very busy two days planned. Important meetings scheduled throughout. Our great Country is extremely well represented. Will be very productive!

Tweet: #USMCA🇺🇸🇲🇽🇨🇦

Tweet: Just signed one of the most important and largest Trade Deals in U.S. and World History. The United States Mexico and Canada worked so well together in crafting this great document. The terrible NAFTA will soon be gone. The USMCA will be fantastic for all!

Tweet: To the Great people of Alaska. You have been hit hard by a “big one.” Please follow the directions of the highly trained professionals who are there to help you. Your Federal Government will spare no expense. God Bless you ALL!

Tweet: Great reviews on the USMCA - sooo much better than NAFTA!

Tweet: Great day at the #G20Summit in Buenos Aires Argentina. Thank you!

Tweet: Watch @seanhannity on @FoxNews NOW. Enjoy!

Tweet: Statement from President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on the Passing of Former President George H.W. Bush

Tweet: President George H.W. Bush led a long successful and beautiful life. Whenever I was with him I saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family. His accomplishments were great from beginning to end. He was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all!

Tweet: This week Jews around the world will celebrate the miracles of Hanukkah. @FLOTUS Melania and I send our very best wishes for a blessed and Happy Hanukkah!

Tweet: China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%.

Tweet: My meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one. Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward! Very good things will happen. We are dealing from great strength but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed. Level the field!

Tweet: Farmers will be a a very BIG and FAST beneficiary of our deal with China. They intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately. We make the finest and cleanest product in the World and that is what China wants. Farmers I LOVE YOU!

Tweet: President Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship. He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great Nations. A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL!

Tweet: I am certain that at some time in the future President Xi and I together with President Putin of Russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race. The U.S. spent 716 Billion Dollars this year. Crazy!

Tweet: We would save Billions of Dollars if the Democrats would give us the votes to build the Wall. Either way people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally! We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary. Also STOP THE DRUGS!

Tweet: “I will never testify against Trump.” This statement was recently made by Roger Stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about “President Trump.” Nice to know that some people still have “guts!”

Tweet: Bob Mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of Angry Democrats don’t want the truth they only want lies. The truth is very bad for their mission!

Tweet: Looking forward to being with the Bush Family to pay my respects to President George H.W. Bush.

Tweet: Congratulations to newly inaugurated Mexican President @lopezobrador_. He had a tremendous political victory with the great support of the Mexican People. We will work well together for many years to come!

Tweet: #Remembering41

Tweet: Looking forward to being with the wonderful Bush family at Blair House today. The former First Lady will be coming over to the White House this morning to be given a tour of the Christmas decorations by Melania. The elegance &amp; precision of the last two days have been remarkable!

Tweet: Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security including a Wall is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months. Get it done!

Tweet: Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip including stops from Argentina. Not to sound naive or anything but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. ALL subjects discussed!

Tweet: Looking forward to being with the Bush family. This is not a funeral this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life. He will be missed!

Tweet: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is not restricted. The World does not want to see or need higher oil prices!

Tweet: Doug Wead a truly great presidential historian had a wonderful take on a very beautiful moment in history the funeral service today of President Bush. Doug was able to brilliantly cover some very important and interesting periods of time! @LouDobbs

Tweet: Working hard thank you!

Tweet: Without the phony Russia Witch Hunt and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts Judge’s Military Vets etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by Rasmussen. It’s called Presidential Harassment!

Tweet: My thoughts and prayers are with the @USMC crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of Japan. Thank you to @USForcesJapan for their immediate response and rescue efforts. Whatever you need we are here for you. @IIIMEF

Tweet: Does the Fake News Media ever mention the fact that Republicans with the very important help of my campaign Rallies WON THE UNITED STATES SENATE 53 to 47? All I hear is that the Open Border Dems won the House. Senate alone approves judges &amp; others. Big Republican Win!

Tweet: Statement from China: “The teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other. We are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days.” I agree!

Tweet: Jerome Corsi: ”This is not justice this is not America. This is a political prosecution. The Special Prosecutor (Counsel) to get this plea deal demanded I lie and violate the law. They’re the criminals.” He is not alone. 17 Angry Dems. People forced to lie. Sad! @Trish_Regan

Tweet: Trish_Regan: “Did the FBI follow protocol to obtain the FISA warrant? I don’t think so. The Dossier was opposition research funded by opponents. Don’t use Government resources to take down political foes. Weaponizing Government for gain.” Is this really America? Witch Hunt!

Tweet: FAKE NEWS - THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!

Tweet: Arizona together with our Military and Border Patrol is bracing for a massive surge at a NON-WALLED area. WE WILL NOT LET THEM THROUGH. Big danger. Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall!

Tweet: China talks are going very well!

Tweet: It has been incorrectly reported that Rudy Giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the Mueller Report. That is Fake News. Already 87 pages done but obviously cannot complete until we see the final Witch Hunt Report.

Tweet: Today we honor those who perished 77 years ago at Pearl Harbor and we salute every veteran who served in World War II over the 4 years that followed that horrific attack. God Bless America!

Tweet: We will be doing a major Counter Report to the Mueller Report. This should never again be allowed to happen to a future President of the United States!

Tweet: I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador. I want to congratulate Heather and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country!

Tweet: Mike Pompeo is doing a great job I am very proud of him. His predecessor Rex Tillerson didn’t have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldn’t get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell. Now it is a whole new ballgame great spirit at State!

Tweet: Hopefully Mitch McConnell will ask for a VOTE on Criminal Justice Reform. It is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support. It will also help a lot of people save taxpayer dollars and keep our communities safe. Go for it Mitch!

Tweet: It is being reported that Leakin' James Comey was told by Department of Justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions. Total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous Administration. Force him to answer the questions under oath!

Tweet: Totally clears the President. Thank you!

Tweet: The Paris Agreement isn’t working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money much to third world countries (that are questionably run) in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting “We Want Trump!” Love France.

Tweet: The idea of a European Military didn’t work out too well in W.W. I or 2. But the U.S. was there for you and always will be. All we ask is that you pay your fair share of NATO. Germany is paying 1% while the U.S. pays 4.3% of a much larger GDP - to protect Europe. Fairness!

Tweet: AFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30000000) NO COLLUSION!

Tweet: “This is collusion illusion there is no smoking gun here. At this late date after all that we have gone through after millions have been spent we have no Russian Collusion. There is nothing impeachable here.” @GeraldoRivera Time for the Witch Hunt to END!

Tweet: Very sad day &amp; night in Paris. Maybe it’s time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes? The U.S. was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year!

Tweet: Great honor to be headed to the Army-Navy game today. Will be there shortly landing now!

Tweet: #ArmyNavyGame🇺🇸

Tweet: It was my honor to attend today’s #ArmyNavyGame in Philadelphia. A GREAT game played all around by our HEROES. Congratulations @ArmyWP_Football on the win!

Tweet: On 245 occasions former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didn’t know didn’t recall or couldn’t remember things when asked. Opened investigations on 4 Americans (not 2) - didn’t know who signed off and didn’t know Christopher Steele. All lies!

Tweet: Leakin’ James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day. His Friday testimony was so untruthful! This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President. They are now exposed!

Tweet: The Trump Administration has accomplished more than any other U.S. Administration in its first two (not even) years of existence &amp; we are having a great time doing it! All of this despite the Fake News Media which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the Enemy of the People!

Tweet: I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff. Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda. I will be making a decision soon!

Tweet: James Comey’s behind closed doors testimony reveals that “there was not evidence of Campaign Collusion” with Russia when he left the FBI. In other words the Witch Hunt is illegal and should never have been started!

Tweet: “Former FBI Director James Comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the Democrats paid for that phony Trump Dossier.” @LouDobbs Details on Tuesday night.

Tweet: Great job by Michael Anton on @foxandfriends. A true National Security expert!

Tweet: Very productive conversations going on with China! Watch for some important announcements!

Tweet: Fake News has it purposely wrong. Many over ten are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff position. Why wouldn’t someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington. Please report news correctly. Thank you!

Tweet: James Comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow Democrats to take back the White House in 2020. In other words he is and has been a Democrat. Comey had no right heading the FBI at any time but especially after his mind exploded!

Tweet: “I don’t care what you think of the President...it cannot bleed over to the FBI...Comey is confirming there is bias in the FBI...” -Chris Swecker

Tweet: Thanks to Leader McConnell for agreeing to bring a Senate vote on Criminal Justice this week! These historic changes will make communities SAFER and SAVE tremendous taxpayers dollars. It brings much needed hope to many families during the Holiday Season.

Tweet: Another very bad terror attack in France. We are going to strengthen our borders even more. Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!

Tweet: The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing but they can’t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?

Tweet: .@FLOTUS Melania will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight on @FoxNews at 9:00pmE!

Tweet: I often stated “One way or the other Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.” This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada) the USMCA is so much better than the old very costly &amp; anti-USA NAFTA deal that just by the money we save MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!

Tweet: WITCH HUNT!

Tweet: Just did an interview with @HARRISFAULKNER on @FoxNews airing now (1pmE.) Enjoy!

Tweet: Happy 382nd Birthday @USNationalGuard. Our entire Nation is forever grateful for all you do 24/7/365. We love you! #Guard382

Tweet: Today it was my honor to welcome our Nation’s newly elected Governors to the @WhiteHouse!

Tweet: Let’s not do a shutdown Democrats - do what’s right for the American People!

Tweet: China just announce the there economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them. They have just suspended U.S. Tariff Hikes. U.S. is doing very well. China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. It could happen and rather soon!

Tweet: Thank you to @tim_cook for agreeing to expand operations in the U.S. and thereby creating thousands of jobs!

Tweet: For the record there were MANY people who wanted to be the White House Chief of Staff. Mick M will do a GREAT job!

Tweet: As I predicted all along Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy get it done!

Tweet: Wow but not surprisingly ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!

Tweet: Never in the history of our Country has the “press” been more dishonest than it is today. Stories that should be good are bad. Stories that should be bad are horrible. Many stories like with the REAL story on Russia Clinton &amp; the DNC seldom get reported. Too bad!

Tweet: The pathetic and dishonest Weekly Standard run by failed prognosticator Bill Kristol (who like many others never had a clue) is flat broke and out of business. Too bad. May it rest in peace!

Tweet: Wow 19000 Texts between Lisa Page and her lover Peter S of the FBI in charge of the Russia Hoax were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. Such a big story that will never be covered by the Fake News. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage hour by hour of networks like NBC &amp; Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live. It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts can’t be legal? Only defame &amp; belittle! Collusion?

Tweet: So where are all the missing Text messages between fired FBI agents Peter S and the lovely Lisa Page his lover. Just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean. What an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted Witch Hunt moves ever so slowly forward. Want them!

Tweet: Remember Michael Cohen only became a “Rat” after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable &amp; unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY’S OFFICE! Why didn’t they break into the DNC to get the Server or Crooked’s office?

Tweet: At the request of many I will be reviewing the case of a “U.S. Military hero” Major Matt Golsteyn who is charged with murder. He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas. @PeteHegseth @FoxNews

Tweet: Judge Ken Starr former Solicitor Generel &amp; Independent Counsel just stated that after two years “there is no evidence or proof of collusion” &amp; further that “there is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the President.” Thank you Judge. @FoxNews

Tweet: The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years. However if you don’t separate FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids!

Tweet: Required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of @RodBlagojevich and the @trishregan interview with a Jerome Corsi. If that doesn’t tell you something about what has been going on in our Country nothing will. Very sad!

Tweet: Required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of Rod Blagojevich and the @trish_regan interview with a Jerome Corsi. If that doesn’t tell you something about what has been going on in our Country nothing will. Very sad!

Tweet: The DEDUCTIBLE which comes with ObamaCare is so high that it is practically not even useable! Hurts families badly. We have a chance working with the Democrats to deliver great HealthCare! A confirming Supreme Court Decision will lead to GREAT HealthCare results for Americans!

Tweet: Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Boarder Security without a Wall write them off as just another politician following the party line. Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control!

Tweet: It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation the outside world blowing up around us Paris is burning and China way down the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. Take the Victory!

Tweet: Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall write them off as just another politician following the party line. Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control!

Tweet: Today I am making good on my promise to defend our Farmers &amp; Ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations. I have authorized Secretary Perdue to implement the 2nd round of Market Facilitation Payments. Our economy is stronger than ever–we stand with our Farmers!

Tweet: Biggest outrage yet in the long winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover Lisa Page were purposely &amp; illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax which is now under protest!

Tweet: Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say despite tremendous pressure being put on him about Russian Collusion in our great and obviously highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!

Tweet: I hope the people over at the Fed will read today’s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also don’t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B’s. Feel the market don’t just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!

Tweet: Facebook Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous! Twitter in fact has made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump. They have removed many names &amp; greatly slowed the level and speed of increase. They have acknowledged-done NOTHING!

Tweet: Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. How was this allowed to happen?

Tweet: Michael Isikoff was the first to report Dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the Dossier claims. The whole Russian Collusion thing was a HOAX but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed?

Tweet: “President Donald J. Trump’s Commission on School Safety examined ways to make our schools safe for all students and teachers.” Read more:

Tweet: Congratulations to @MarthaMcSally on her appointment by Governor @DougDucey as the Great new Senator from Arizona - I have no doubt she will do a fantastic job!

Tweet: In our Country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but when it comes to Border Security and the Military the Democrats fight to the death. We won on the Military which is being completely rebuilt. One way or the other we will win on the Wall!

Tweet: Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border including large scale criminal and drug inflow the United States Military will build the Wall!

Tweet: We have defeated ISIS in Syria my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.

Tweet: After historic victories against ISIS it’s time to bring our great young people home!

Tweet: Col. Jim Carafano on @IngrahamAngle “Trump has made the Middle East a better place. When Trump came into office ISIS was running amuck in the Middle East. Over a million refugees poured into Western Europe - none of that is happening today. That’s all due to Trump.”

Tweet: “Trump gets no credit for what he’s done in the Middle East.” @IngrahamAngle So true thank you Laura!

Tweet: “I’m proud of the President today to hear that he is declaring victory in Syria.” Senator Rand Paul. “I couldn’t agree more with the presidents decision. By definition this is the opposite of an Obama decision. Senator Mike Lee

Tweet: Getting out of Syria was no surprise. I’ve been campaigning on it for years and six months ago when I very publicly wanted to do it I agreed to stay longer. Russia Iran Syria &amp; others are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing there work. Time to come home &amp; rebuild. #MAGA

Tweet: The Democrats who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security are putting politics over Country. What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation including infrastructure unless it has perfect Border Security. U.S.A. WINS!

Tweet: With so much talk about the Wall people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol ICE and our great Military. Remember the Caravans? Well they didn’t get through and none are forming or on their way. Border is tight. Fake News silent!

Tweet: When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW). It didn’t happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good!

Tweet: Congress just passed the Criminal Justice Reform Bill known as the #FirstStepAct. Congratulations! This is a great bi-partisan achievement for everybody. When both parties work together we can keep our Country safer. A wonderful thing for the U.S.A.!!

Tweet: So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives &amp; billions of $$$. Why are we fighting for our enemy Syria by staying &amp; killing ISIS for them Russia Iran &amp; other locals? Time to focus on our Country &amp; bring our youth back home where they belong!

Tweet: Farm Bill signing in 15 minutes! #Emmys #TBT

Tweet: Democrats it is time to come together and put the SAFETY of the AMERICAN PEOPLE before POLITICS. Border security must become a #1 priority!

Tweet: Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall. The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. So proud of you all. Now on to the Senate!

Tweet: Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week live from the Oval Office that the Republicans didn’t have the votes for Border Security. Today the House Republicans voted and won 217-185. Nancy does not have to apologize. All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!

Tweet: Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything. He will need Democrat votes but as shown in the House good things happen. If enough Dems don’t vote it will be a Democrat Shutdown! House Republicans were great yesterday!

Tweet: No matter what happens today in the Senate Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves. They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall. Not one Democrat voted yes and we won big. I am very proud of you!

Tweet: The Democrats whose votes we need in the Senate will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don’t want Open Borders and Crime!

Tweet: House Republican Vote 217-185.

Tweet: Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security!

Tweet: Even President Ronald Reagan tried for 8 years to build a Border Wall or Fence and was unable to do so. Others also have tried. We will get it done one way or the other!

Tweet: Mitch use the Nuclear Option and get it done! Our Country is counting on you!

Tweet: Thank you @SteveDaines for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on DESPERATELY NEEDED Border Security! Have my total support.

Tweet: There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia - Never just look at the facts. The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.

Tweet: General Anthony Tata author “Dark Winter.” I think the President is making the exact right move in Syria. All the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from Syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on ISIS intelligence and gave rise to ISIS.”

Tweet: The Democrats now own the shutdown!

Tweet: I’ve done more damage to ISIS than all recent presidents....not even close!

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to sign the #FirstStepAct - a monumental bi-partisan win for the American people!

Tweet: Today it was my honor to sign into law H.R. 7213 the “Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 2018.” The Act redesignates the @DHSgov Domestic Nuclear Detection Office as the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. Read more:

Tweet: A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful!

Tweet: Some of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now. Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America’s Southern Border!

Tweet: Wishing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a full and speedy recovery!

Tweet: OUR GREAT COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!

Tweet: Will be having lunch in White House residence with large group concerning Border Security.

Tweet: The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall. Let work begin!

Tweet: I won an election said to be one of the greatest of all time based on getting out of endless &amp; costly foreign wars &amp; also based on Strong Borders which will keep our Country safe. We fight for the borders of other countries but we won’t fight for the borders of our own!

Tweet: Senate adjourns until December 27th.

Tweet: I will not be going to Florida because of the Shutdown - Staying in the White House! #MAGA

Tweet: Brett McGurk who I do not know was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!

Tweet: If anybody but your favorite President Donald J. Trump announced that after decimating ISIS in Syria we were going to bring our troops back home (happy &amp; healthy) that person would be the most popular hero in America. With me hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!

Tweet: When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn’t I thought I should. Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S.

Tweet: The only way to stop drugs gangs human trafficking criminal elements and much else from coming into our Country is with a Wall or Barrier. Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!

Tweet: I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1 2019. Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy &amp; previously Boeing. He will be great!

Tweet: I just had a long and productive call with President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey. We discussed ISIS our mutual involvement in Syria &amp; the slow &amp; highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area. After many years they are coming home. We also discussed heavily expanded Trade.

Tweet: Unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in Indonesia. More than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for. We are praying for recovery and healing. America is with you!

Tweet: We signed two pieces of major legislation this week Criminal Justice Reform and the Farm Bill. These are two Big Deals but all the Fake News Media wants to talk about is “the mistake” of bringing our young people back home from the Never Ending Wars. It all began 19 years ago!

Tweet: Thanks @RandPaul “I am very proud of the President. This is exactly what he promised and I think the people agree with him. We’ve been at war too long and in too many places...spent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere. He’s different...that’s why he got elected.”

Tweet: “It should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world. This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades and he’s right...The generals still don’t get the mistake.” @RandPaul

Tweet: Mitch McConnell just told a group of people and me that he has been in the U.S. Senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best &amp; most productive of his career. Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts VA Choice Farm Bill Criminal Justice Reform Judgeships &amp; much more. Great!

Tweet: The most important way to stop gangs drugs human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border. We need Border Security and as EVERYONE knows you can’t have Border Security without a Wall. The Drones &amp; Technology are just bells and whistles. Safety for America!

Tweet: “The President has been remarkable. I do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is.” Thank you to Tammy Bruce and Steve Hilton. Presidential Harassment has been with me from the beginning!

Tweet: President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria....and he is a man who can do it plus Turkey is right “next door.” Our troops are coming home!

Tweet: Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence. It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked that they turned against it. Desperately needed!

Tweet: For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH &amp; sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker.

Tweet: AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!

Tweet: The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch - he can’t putt!

Tweet: I never “lashed out” at the Acting Attorney General of the U.S. a man for whom I have great respect. This is a made up story one of many by the Fake News Media!

Tweet: The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is without the Wall much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!

Tweet: Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria instead of the United States. See? Isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country the U.S. that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!

Tweet: I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!

Tweet: Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea – Progress being made. Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim!

Tweet: I am in the Oval Office &amp; just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas. We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of Dollars &amp; lives will be saved!

Tweet: Merry Christmas!

Tweet: I hope everyone even the Fake News Media is having a great Christmas! Our Country is doing very well. We are securing our Borders making great new Trade Deals and bringing our Troops Back Home. We are finally putting America First. MERRY CHRISTMAS! #MAGA

Tweet: .@FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to visit our incredible troops at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. GOD BLESS THE U.S.A.!

Tweet: Just returned from visiting our troops in Iraq and Germany. One thing is certain we have incredible people representing our Country - people that know how to win!

Tweet: Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs Human TraffickingGang Members &amp; Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?

Tweet: The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn’t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain thereby setting up a Supteme Court case. After ruling Dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall.

Tweet: The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall where they almost all recently agreed it should be built is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting &amp; expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years a U.S. record!

Tweet: The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn’t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain thereby setting up a Supreme Court case. After ruling Dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall.

Tweet: “Border Patrol Agents want the Wall.” Democrat’s say they don’t want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed) and they don’t want ICE. They don’t have much to campaign on do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!

Tweet: There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!

Tweet: I totally agree!

Tweet: Brad Blakeman: “The American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. The Pesident says look this is your neighborhood you’ve got to stand up to protect yourselves. Don’t always look to America.”

Tweet: Brad Blakeman: “The American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. The President says look this is your neighborhood you’ve got to stand up to protect yourselves. Don’t always look to America.”

Tweet: This isn’t about the Wall everybody knows that a Wall will work perfectly (In Israel the Wall works 99.9%). This is only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump &amp; the Republicans have a win. They may have the 10 Senate votes but we have the issue Border Security. 2020!

Tweet: CNN &amp; others within the Fake News Universe were going wild about my signing MAGA hats for our military in Iraq and Germany. If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat I will sign. Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported!

Tweet: We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall &amp; also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress &amp; President who would approve!

Tweet: Thank you to Sean Parnell for the nice comments on @foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to Melania and I in Iraq and Germany. Great things are happening!

Tweet: The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover Agent Peter S. These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax. This is a total Obstruction of Justice. All Texts Demanded!

Tweet: I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security. From what I hear they are spending so much time on Presidential Harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!

Tweet: Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made!

Tweet: For those that naively ask why didn’t the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES and they will gives us “NONE” for Border Security! Now we have to do it the hard way with a Shutdown. Too bad! @FoxNews

Tweet: 2018 is being called “THE YEAR OF THE WORKER” by Steve Moore co-author of “Trumponomics.” It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the “best job market in 50 years and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers. Big wage gains.”

Tweet: “Absolutely nothing” (on Russian Collusion). Kimberley Strassel The Wall Street Journal. The Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics. The only Russian Collusion was with Hillary and the Democrats!

Tweet: “It turns out to be true now that the Department of Justice and the FBI under President Obama rigged the investigation for Hillary and really turned the screws on Trump and now it looks like in a corrupt &amp; illegal way. The facts are out now. Whole Hoax exposed. @JesseBWatters

Tweet: Veterans on President Trump’s handling of Border Security - 62% Approval Rating. On being a strong leader - 59%. AP Poll. Thank you!

Tweet: Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown. No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!

Tweet: President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing slightly larger version!

Tweet: An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!

Tweet: I campaigned on Border Security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall. Our Southern Border has long been an “Open Wound” where drugs criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country. Dems should get back here an fix now!

Tweet: I am the only person in America who could say that “I’m bringing our great troops back home with victory” and get BAD press. It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever they would still be unhappy!

Tweet: I’m in the Oval Office. Democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 3013. One more yes but with me in office I’ll get it built and Fast!

Tweet: I’m in the Oval Office. Democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes but with me in office I’ll get it built and Fast!

Tweet: It’s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn’t work. It does and properly built almost 100%! They say it’s old technology - but so is the wheel. They now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!

Tweet: HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Tweet: MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal the USMCA that will replace the horrendous NAFTA Trade Deal which has so badly hurt our Country. Mexico &amp; Canada will also thrive - good for all!

Tweet: Dr. Sebastian Gorka a very good and talented guy has a great new book just out “Why We Fight.” Lots of insight - Enjoy!

Tweet: HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA! 2019 WILL BE A FANTASTIC YEAR FOR THOSE NOT SUFFERING FROM TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. JUST CALM DOWN AND ENJOY THE RIDE GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR OUR COUNTRY!

Tweet: Happy New Year!

Tweet: The Democrats much as I suspected have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!

Tweet: “General” McChrystal got fired like a dog by Obama. Last assignment a total bust. Known for big dumb mouth. Hillary lover!

Tweet: One thing has now been proven. The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!

Tweet: Congratulations to President @JairBolsonaro who just made a great inauguration speech - the U.S.A. is with you!

Tweet: Border Security and the Wall “thing” and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let’s make a deal?

Tweet: Gas prices are low and expected to go down this year. This would be good!

Tweet: Washington Examiner - “MAGA list: 205 ‘historic results’ help Trump make case for 2020 re-election.” True!

Tweet: “Kim Jong Un says North Korea will not make or test nuclear weapons or give them to others - &amp; he is ready to meet President Trump anytime.” PBS News Hour. I also look forward to meeting with Chairman Kim who realizes so well that North Korea possesses great economic potential!

Tweet: Do you think it’s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling? Low gas prices are like another Tax Cut!

Tweet: For FAR TOO LONG Senate Democrats have been Obstructing more than 350 Nominations. These great Americans left their jobs to serve our Country but can’t because Dems are blocking them some for two years-historic record. Passed committees but Schumer putting them on hold. Bad!

Tweet: Here we go with Mitt Romney but so fast! Question will be is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player &amp; WIN!

Tweet: Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!

Tweet: Sadly there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall!

Tweet: “MAGA list: 205 ‘historic results’ help Trump make case for 2020 re-election”

Tweet: The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can’t win based on all of the achievements of “Trump” so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment. For them strictly politics!

Tweet: The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on. At some point this had to be done!

Tweet: The RNC has a great Chairwoman in Ronna McDaniel and the @GOP has never been stronger. We achieved historic wins with her help last year! #MAGA🇺🇸

Tweet: As I have stated many times if the Democrats take over the House or Senate there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they can’t win in 2020 too much success!

Tweet: How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia it was the Dems that Colluded) had the most successful first two years of any president and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?

Tweet: GREAT JOBS NUMBERS JUST ANNOUNCED!

Tweet: “Job growth surges by 312000 in December”

Tweet: The story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. I’m sure he is a fine man but I don’t know Jim and never met him. Patrick Shanahan who is Acting Secretary of Defense is doing a great job!

Tweet: Great new book by Dr. Robert Jeffress “Choosing the Extraordinary Life.” Get it and enjoy! @LouDobbs

Tweet: Thank you to Kanye West for your nice words. Criminal Justice Reform is now law - passed in a very bipartisan way!

Tweet: Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events including Fake sources has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!

Tweet: The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall) something which everyone other than drug dealers human traffickers and criminals want very badly! This would be so easy to do!

Tweet: Many people currently a part of my opposition including President Obama &amp; the Dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine &amp; settled. While no big deal I did not commit a campaign violation!

Tweet: I don’t care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go where are the Dems?

Tweet: We are working hard at the Border but we need a WALL! In 2018 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized 17000 adults arrested with criminal records and 6000 gang members including MS-13 apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem.

Tweet: The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid but they don’t want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!

Tweet: Great Tweet today by Tyler Q. Houlton @SpoxDHS on the #FakeNews being put out by @CNN a proud member of the Opposition Party. @TSA is doing a great job!

Tweet: “Former @NYTimes editor Jill Abramson rips paper's ‘unmistakably anti-Trump’ bias.”Ms. Abramson is 100% correct. Horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write. Hence the term Fake News Enemy of the People and Opposition Party!

Tweet: Drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing. Not being fair to the consumer or to our Country!

Tweet: V.P. Mike Pence and team just left the White House. Briefed me on their meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives. Not much headway made today. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!

Tweet: “Jobs up big plus 312000. Record number working. Manufacturing best in 20 years (Previous administration said this could not happen). Hispanic unemployment lowest ever. Dow plus 747 (for day).” @DRUDGE_REPORT

Tweet: “The number of employed Americans has now set a 14th record under President Trump. Over the year average hourly earnings have increased by 84 cents or 3.2%. Participation Rate hits Trump-Era High.” CNS NEWS. And we will do even better with new trade deals and all else!

Tweet: AP-NORC POLL: “Immigration among the top concerns in 2019.” People want to stop drugs and criminals at the Border. Want Border Security! Tell the Dems to do the inevitable now rather than later. The wait is costly and dangerous!

Tweet: Will be going to Camp David tomorrow morning for meetings on Border Security and many other topics with @WhiteHouse senior staff.

Tweet: “We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected undocumented unchecked...” Barrack Obama 2005. I voted when I was a Senator to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in...” Hillary Clinton 2015.

Tweet: Excited to see our friends in Egypt opening the biggest Cathedral in the Middle East. President El-Sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future!

Tweet: Our GREAT MILITARY has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole. We have just killed the leader of that attack Jamal al-Badawi. Our work against al Qaeda continues. We will never stop in our fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism!

Tweet: V.P. Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives today. Many details of Border Security were discussed. We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger &amp; less obtrusive. Good solution and made in the U.S.A.

Tweet: Congressman Adam Smith the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee just stated “Yes there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. It’s been done a number of times.” No doubt but let’s get our deal done in Congress!

Tweet: I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.

Tweet: Endless Wars especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago &amp; those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing will eventually come to a glorious end!

Tweet: Economic numbers looking REALLY good. Can you imagine if I had long term ZERO interest rates to play with like the past administration rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today. That would have been SO EASY! Still markets up BIG since 2016 Election!

Tweet: “The President is the biggest and best supporter of the Steel Industry in many years. We are now doing really well. The Tariffs let us compete. Was unfair that the Steel Industry lost its jobs to unfair trade laws. Very positive outcome.” Mark Glyptis United Steelworkers

Tweet: Talks with China are going very well!

Tweet: Congratulations to a truly great football team the Clemson Tigers on an incredible win last night against a powerful Alabama team. A big win also for the Great State of South Carolina. Look forward to seeing the team and their brilliant coach for the second time at the W.H.

Tweet: Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!

Tweet: Our Country is doing so well in so many ways. Great jobs numbers with a record setting December. We are rebuilding our military. Vets finally have Choice &amp; Accountability. Economy &amp; GDP are strong. Tax &amp; Reg cuts historic. Trade deals great. But we MUST fix our Southern Border!

Tweet: Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forrest fires that with proper Forrest Management would never happen. Unless they get their act together which is unlikely I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives &amp; money!

Tweet: Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that with proper Forest Management would never happen. Unless they get their act together which is unlikely I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives &amp; money!

Tweet: Thank you to all of America's brave police deputies sheriffs and federal law enforcement on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day! We love you and will always support you.

Tweet: Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said NO. I said bye-bye nothing else works!

Tweet: The Mainstream Media has NEVER been more dishonest than it is now. NBC and MSNBC are going Crazy. They report stories purposely the exact opposite of the facts. They are truly the Opposition Party working with the Dems. May even be worse than Fake News CNN if that is possible!

Tweet: Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon somewhat of a White House tradition or custom to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media which has gone totally bonkers!

Tweet: Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I “slammed the table &amp; walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum.” Because I knew he would say that and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security I politely said bye-bye and left no slamming!

Tweet: There is GREAT unity with the Republicans in the House and Senate despite the Fake News Media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise. The Opposition Party &amp; the Dems know we must have Strong Border Security but don’t want to give “Trump” another one of many wins!

Tweet: “Great support for Border Security and the Wall.” @foxandfriends Even greater than anyone would know! “Presidents supporters do not want him to cave.” @SteveDoocy I won’t!

Tweet: Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Texas! #MAGA

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: President Obama thank you for your great support – I have been saying this all along!

Tweet: Because of the Democrats intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation I am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to Davos Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. My warmest regards and apologies to the @WEF!

Tweet: Will be interviewed at the Border by @seanhannity on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00. Enjoy!

Tweet: We lose 300 Americans a week 90% of which comes through the Southern Border. These numbers will be DRASTICALLY REDUCED if we have a Wall!

Tweet: I often said during rallies with little variation that “Mexico will pay for the Wall.” We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico. It is Billions of Dollars a year better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces. The difference pays for Wall many times over!

Tweet: H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay including a potential path to citizenship. We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.

Tweet: The Fake News Media keeps saying we haven’t built any NEW WALL. Below is a section just completed on the Border. Anti-climbing feature included. Very high strong and beautiful! Also many miles already renovated and in service!

Tweet: I look forward to hosting right out of the great State of South Carolina the 2019 NCAA Football Champion Clemson Tigers at the White House on Monday January 14th. What a game what a coach what a team!

Tweet: Drug prices declined in 2018 the first time in nearly half a century. During the first 19 months of my Administration Americans saved $26 Billion on prescription drugs. Our policies to get cheaper generic drugs to market are working!

Tweet: .@CNN called a San Diego news station (@KUSINews) for negative reports on the Wall. When the station said that Walls work CNN no longer had interest. #FakeNews

Tweet: Wow just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons opened up an investigation on me for no reason &amp; with no proof after I fired Lyin’ James Comey a total sleaze!

Tweet: I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time &amp; as I have often said getting along with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!

Tweet: Lyin’ James Comey Andrew McCabe Peter S and his lover agent Lisa Page &amp; more all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the “insurance policy?” This is it!

Tweet: Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border. I am in the White House waiting for you!

Tweet: 23% of Federal inmates are illegal immigrants. Border arrests are up 240%. In the Great State of Texas between 2011 &amp; 2018 there were a total of 292000 crimes by illegal aliens 539 murders 32000 assaults 3426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges. Democrats come back!

Tweet: Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes! Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man. Tell them to get it done! Humanitarian Crisis.

Tweet: We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their “vacations” and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!

Tweet: I will be interviewed by Jeanine Pirro at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Watch @JesseBWatters before and @greggutfeld after. All terrific people. I am in the White House waiting for Cryin’ Chuck and Nancy to call so we can start helping our Country both at the Border and from within!

Tweet: Democrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and don’t want to include in talks. Many Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side watch!

Tweet: The building of the Wall on the Southern Border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire Country!

Tweet: I’m in the White House waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking!

Tweet: The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!

Tweet: Thousands of illegal aliens who have committed sexual crimes against children are right now in Texas prisons. Most came through our Southern Border. We can end this easily - We need a Steel Barrier or Wall. Walls Work! John Jones Texas Department of Public Safety. @FoxNews

Tweet: Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden. Really is something - SPECIAL COUNTRY SPECIAL PLACE!

Tweet: So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting I understand is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands!

Tweet: If Elizabeth Warren often referred to by me as Pocahontas did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen with her husband dressed in full Indian garb it would have been a smash!

Tweet: If Elizabeth Warren often referred to by me as Pocahontas did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen with her husband dressed in full Indian garb it would have been a smash!

Tweet: Best line in the Elizabeth Warren beer catastrophe is to her husband “Thank you for being here. I’m glad you’re here” It’s their house he’s supposed to be there!

Tweet: “Gas prices drop across the United States because President Trump has deregulated Energy and we are now producing a great deal more oil than ever before.” @foxandfriends But this is bad news for Russia why would President Trump do such a thing? Thought he worked for Kremlin?

Tweet: I’ve been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!

Tweet: Nancy and Cryin’ Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their and the Democrats fault!

Tweet: Getting ready to address the Farm Convention today in Nashville Tennessee. Love our farmers love Tennessee - a great combination! See you in a little while.

Tweet: “Dems in Puerto Rico as Shutdown hits day 24.” @foxandfriends

Tweet: The Fake News gets crazier and more dishonest every single day. Amazing to watch as certain people covering me and the tremendous success of this administration have truly gone MAD! Their Fake reporting creates anger and disunity. Take two weeks off and come back rested. Chill!

Tweet: Getting ready to go on stage at the #AFBF100 in New Orleans - packed house! I will try and match the great game played yesterday by the New Orleans Saints and their incredible QB Drew Brees. People here are very excited by the team. Going on stage now!

Tweet: Spoke w/ President Erdogan of Turkey to advise where we stand on all matters including our last two weeks of success in fighting the remnants of ISIS and 20 mile safe zone. Also spoke about economic development between the U.S. &amp; Turkey - great potential to substantially expand!

Tweet: The rank and file of the FBI are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about Lyin’ James Comey and the so-called “leaders” of the FBI. Twelve have been fired or forced to leave. They got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation. Bad!

Tweet: Just announced that Veterans unemployment has reached an 18 year low really good news for our Vets and their families. Will soon be an all time low! Do you think the media will report on this and all of the other great economic news?

Tweet: Volkswagen will be spending 800 million dollars in Chattanooga Tennessee. They will be making Electric Cars. Congratulations to Chattanooga and Tennessee on a job well done. A big win!

Tweet: A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras. Tell Nancy and Chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall or Steel Barrier will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!

Tweet: Polls are now showing that people are beginning to understand the Humanitarian Crisis and Crime at the Border. Numbers are going up fast over 50%. Democrats will soon be known as the Party of Crime. Ridiculous that they don’t want Border Security!

Tweet: Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House. Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid) over 1000 hamberders etc. Within one hour it was all gone. Great guys and big eaters!

Tweet: Why is Nancy Pelosi getting paid when people who are working are not?

Tweet: Congratulations @ClemsonFB!

Tweet: Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House. Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid) over 1000 hamburgers etc. Within one hour it was all gone. Great guys and big eaters!

Tweet: There are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world with 45 countries planning or building Walls. Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful. Stop the crime at our Southern Border!

Tweet: It is becoming more and more obvious that the Radical Democrats are a Party of open borders and crime. They want nothing to do with the major Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border. #2020!

Tweet: The Left has become totally unhinged. They no longer care what is Right for our Countrty!

Tweet: So funny to watch Schumer groveling. He called for the firing of bad cop James Comey many times - UNTIL I FIRED HIM!

Tweet: Thank you to Amy Kremer Women for Trump Co-Founder for doing such a great interview with Martha MacCallum...and by the way women have the lowest unemployment numbers in many decades - at the highest pay ever. Proud of that!

Tweet: “In 2018 alone 20000 illegal aliens with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the Border and there was a 122% increase in fentanyl being smuggled between ports of entry. Last month alone more than 20000 minors were smuggled into the U.S.” @seanhannity

Tweet: Gregg Jarrett: “Mueller’s prosecutors knew the “Dossier” was the product of bias and deception.” It was a Fake just like so much news coverage in our Country. Nothing but a Witch Hunt from beginning to end!

Tweet: Border rancher: “We’ve found prayer rugs out here. It’s unreal.” Washington Examiner People coming across the Southern Border from many countries some of which would be a big surprise.

Tweet: Why would Nancy Pelosi leave the Country with other Democrats on a seven day excursion when 800000 great people are not getting paid. Also could somebody please explain to Nancy &amp; her “big donors” in wine country that people working on farms (grapes) will have easy access in!

Tweet: “It’s the Democrats keeping everything closed.” @JimInhofe So true!

Tweet: Another big Caravan heading our way. Very hard to stop without a Wall!

Tweet: Kevin Corke @FoxNews “Don’t forget Michael Cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud and as recently as this week the Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars....” Lying to reduce his jail time! Watch father-in-law!

Tweet: Never seen the Republican Party so unified. No “Cave” on the issue of Border and National Security. A beautiful thing to see especially when you hear the new rhetoric spewing from the mouths of the Democrats who talk Open Border High Taxes and Crime. Stop Criminals &amp; Drugs now!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: AMERICA FIRST!

Tweet: I will be making a major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border and the Shutdown tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M. live from the @WhiteHouse.

Tweet: Just a son who loves his Dad. Nice!

Tweet: Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited “Dossier” paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats (as opposition research) on which the entire Russian probe is based! A very sad day for journalism but a great day for our Country!

Tweet: Fake News is truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!

Tweet: Will be leaving for Dover to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our Country!

Tweet: .@newtgingrich just stated that there has been no president since Abraham Lincoln who has been treated worse or more unfairly by the media than your favorite President me! At the same time there has been no president who has accomplished more in his first two years in office!

Tweet: The Economy is one of the best in our history with unemployment at a 50 year low and the Stock Market ready to again break a record (set by us many times) - &amp; all you heard yesterday based on a phony story was Impeachment. You want to see a Stock Market Crash Impeach Trump!

Tweet: Many people are saying that the Mainstream Media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election lead-up) as highlighted by the disgraceful Buzzfeed story &amp; the even more disgraceful coverage!

Tweet: Mexico is doing NOTHING to stop the Caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the United States. We stopped the last two - many are still in Mexico but can’t get through our Wall but it takes a lot of Border Agents if there is no Wall. Not easy!

Tweet: I will be live from the White House at 4:00 P.M.

Tweet: Always heard that as President “it’s all about the economy!” Well we have one of the best economies in the history of our Country. Big GDP lowest unemployment companies coming back to the U.S. in BIG numbers great new trade deals happening &amp; more. But LITTLE media mention!

Tweet: Be careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak. They don’t see crime &amp; drugs they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country &amp; allow people to go back to work.

Tweet: No Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11000000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful Nancy!

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally &amp; has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the “lefties” in her party that she has lost control...And by the way clean up the streets in San Francisco they are disgusting!

Tweet: Nancy I am still thinking about the State of the Union speech there are so many options - including doing it as per your written offer (made during the Shutdown security is no problem) and my written acceptance. While a contract is a contract I’ll get back to you soon!

Tweet: Wow just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19% to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone and they want Security which can only be gotten with a Wall.

Tweet: Don’t forget we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building after all is what I do best even when money is not readily available!

Tweet: Thank you David!

Tweet: The Media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with North Korea. Think of where we were at the end of the Obama Administration compared to now. Great meeting this week with top Reps. Looking forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at end of February!

Tweet: Will do a fantastic job!

Tweet: Thanks James!

Tweet: A truly great First Lady who doesn’t get the credit she deserves!

Tweet: To all of the great people who are working so hard for your Country and not getting paid I say THANK YOU - YOU ARE GREAT PATRIOTS! We must now work together after decades of abuse to finally fix the Humanitarian Criminal &amp; Drug Crisis at our Border. WE WILL WIN BIG!

Tweet: Congratulations to Bob Kraft Bill Belichick Tom Brady and the entire New England Patriots team on a great game and season. Will be a fantastic Super Bowl!

Tweet: Curt Schilling deserves to be in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Great record especially when under pressure and when it mattered most. Do what everyone in Baseball knows is right! @marklevinshow

Tweet: “No President in modern times has kept more promises than Donald Trump!” Thank you Bill Bennett @SteveHiltonx

Tweet: Last year was the best year for American Manufacturing job growth since 1997 or 21 years. The previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the U.S. “you would need a magic wand.” I guess I found the MAGIC WAND - and it is only getting better!

Tweet: Today we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for standing up for the self-evident truth Americans hold so dear that no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth we are all created equal by God. #MLKDay

Tweet: Democrats campaigned on working within Washington and “getting things done!” How is that working out? #2020TAKEBACKTHEHOUSE

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to visit the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial with @VP Mike Pence in honor of #MLKDay

Tweet: China posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies. Makes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal and stop playing around!

Tweet: If Nancy Pelosi thinks that Walls are “immoral” why isn’t she requesting that we take down all of the existing Walls between the U.S. and Mexico even the new ones just built in San Diego at their very strong urging. Let millions of unchecked “strangers” just flow into the U.S.

Tweet: Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country. 26 people killed on the Border in a drug and gang related fight. Two large Caravans from Honduras broke into Mexico and are headed our way. We need a powerful Wall!

Tweet: Democrats are kidding themselves (they don’t really believe it!) if they say you can stop Crime Drugs Human Trafficking and Caravans without a Wall or Steel Barrier. Stop playing games and give America the Security it deserves. A Humanitarian Crisis!

Tweet: Looking like Nick Sandman &amp; Covington Catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false - smeared by media. Not good but making big comeback! “New footage shows that media was wrong about teen’s encounter with Native American” @TuckerCarlson

Tweet: Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be. They have captivated the attention of the world and I know they will use it for the good - maybe even to bring people together. It started off unpleasant but can end in a dream!

Tweet: “The Democrats are playing politics with Border Security.” @foxandfriends

Tweet: Without a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security. With a powerful Wall or Steel Barrier Crime Rates (and Drugs) will go substantially down all over the U.S. The Dems know this but want to play political games. Must finally be done correctly. No Cave!

Tweet: FBI top lawyer confirms “unusual steps.” They relied on the Clinton Campaign’s Fake &amp; Unverified “Dossier” which is illegal. “That has corrupted them. That has enabled them to gather evidence by UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS and that’s what they did to the President.” Judge Napolitano

Tweet: Marist/NPR/PBS Poll shows President Trump’s approval rating among Latinos going to 50% an increase in one year of 19%. Thank you working hard!

Tweet: Never seen @senatemajldr and Republicans so united on an issue as they are on the Humanitarian Crisis &amp; Security on our Southern Border. If we create a Wall or Barrier which prevents Criminals and Drugs from flowing into our Country Crime will go down by record numbers!

Tweet: Last time I went to Davos the Fake News said I should not go there. This year because of the Shutdown I decided not to go and the Fake News said I should be there. The fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them!

Tweet: The United States has a great economic story to tell. Number one in the World by far!

Tweet: The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the “podium” much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely &amp; inaccurately in particular certain members of the press. I told her not to bother the word gets out anyway! Most will never cover us fairly &amp; hence the term Fake News!

Tweet: Congratulations to Mariano Rivera on unanimously being elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame! Not only a great player but a great person. I am thankful for Mariano’s support of the Opioid Drug Abuse Commission and @FitnessGov. #EnterSandman #HOF2019💯

Tweet: Deroy Murdock National Review: “We are now exporting oil which is the first time in my lifetime - we are right now the largest producer of oil and gas. This is not good if you’re Vladimir Putin where your chief export is oil. W.H. Agent - Not good for Kremlin.” @TuckerCarlson

Tweet: Great unity in the Republican Party. Want to once and for all put an end to stoppable crime and drugs! Border Security and Wall. No doubt!

Tweet: BUILD A WALL &amp; CRIME WILL FALL! This is the new theme for two years until the Wall is finished (under construction now) of the Republican Party. Use it and pray!

Tweet: BUILD A WALL &amp; CRIME WILL FALL!

Tweet: “This is everything FDR dreamed about the New Deal to put America back to work. Think of LBJ he gave people food stamps &amp; welfare. Donald Trump’s giving them a job. He’s got a lot of good things to talk about. News stories do not accurately cover him should correct.” @DougWead

Tweet: Without a Wall there cannot be safety and security at the Border or for the U.S.A. BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL!

Tweet: Nancy just said she “just doesn’t understand why?” Very simply without a Wall it all doesn’t work. Our Country has a chance to greatly reduce Crime Human Trafficking Gangs and Drugs. Should have been done for decades. We will not Cave!

Tweet: Great earnings coming out of Stock Market. Too bad Media doesn’t devote much time to this!

Tweet: Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! NO COLLUSION! Border Coyotes Drug Dealers and Human Traffickers are treated better. Who alerted CNN to be there?

Tweet: I wish people would read or listen to my words on the Border Wall. This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days if no deal is done it’s off to the races!

Tweet: If Roger Stone was indicted for lying to Congress what about the lying done by Comey Brennan Clapper Lisa Page &amp; lover Baker and soooo many others? What about Hillary to FBI and her 33000 deleted Emails? What about Lisa &amp; Peter’s deleted texts &amp; Wiener’s laptop? Much more!

Tweet: 21 days goes very quickly. Negotiations with Democrats will start immediately. Will not be easy to make a deal both parties very dug in. The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border &amp; through dialogue. We will build the Wall!

Tweet: We have turned away at great expense two major Caravans but a big one has now formed and is coming. At least 8000 people! If we had a powerful Wall they wouldn’t even try to make the long and dangerous journey. Build the Wall and Crime will Fall!

Tweet: Jens Stoltenberg NATO Secretary General just stated that because of me NATO has been able to raise far more money than ever before from its members after many years of decline. It’s called burden sharing. Also more united. Dems &amp; Fake News like to portray the opposite!

Tweet: Tariffs on the “dumping” of Steel in the United States have totally revived our Steel Industry. New and expanded plants are happening all over the U.S. We have not only saved this important industry but created many jobs. Also billions paid to our treasury. A BIG WIN FOR U.S.

Tweet: How does Da Nang Dick (Blumenthal) serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee when he defrauded the American people about his so called War Hero status in Vietnam only to later admit with tears pouring down his face that he was never in Vietnam. An embarrassment to our Country!

Tweet: A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction. He pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer. He signed a non-disclosure agreement. He is a mess!

Tweet: “Our economy right now is the Gold Standard throughout the World.” @IngrahamAngle So true and not even close!

Tweet: Maduro willing to negotiate with opposition in Venezuela following U.S. sanctions and the cutting off of oil revenues. Guaido is being targeted by Venezuelan Supreme Court. Massive protest expected today. Americans should not travel to Venezuela until further notice.

Tweet: Large sections of WALL have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go. Renovation of existing WALLS is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly Secure Our Border. The Wall is getting done one way or the other!

Tweet: Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL!

Tweet: Very sadly Murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017 to 33341. This is a big contributor to the Humanitarian Crises taking place on our Southern Border and then spreading throughout our Country. Worse even than Afghanistan. Much caused by DRUGS. Wall is being built!

Tweet: With Murders up 33% in Mexico a record why wouldn’t any sane person want to build a Wall! Construction has started and will not stop until it is finished. @LouDobbs @foxandfriends

Tweet: Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time. Democrats despite all of the evidence proof and Caravans coming are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I’ve got you covered. Wall is already being built I don’t expect much help!

Tweet: Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion high taxes Open Borders and Crime!

Tweet: More troops being sent to the Southern Border to stop the attempted Invasion of Illegals through large Caravans into our Country. We have stopped the previous Caravans and we will stop these also. With a Wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive. Being Built!

Tweet: Looking for China to open their Markets not only to Financial Services which they are now doing but also to our Manufacturing Farmers and other U.S. businesses and industries. Without this a deal would be unacceptable!

Tweet: Schumer and the Democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with Iran. They have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our Country. Iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and Iran Deal termination. Dems put us in a bad place - but now good!

Tweet: Ed Gillespie who ran for Governor of the Great State of Virginia against Ralph Northam must now be thinking Malpractice and Dereliction of Duty with regard to his Opposition Research Staff. If they find that terrible picture before the election he wins by 20 points!

Tweet: I will be interviewed Sunday morning on @FaceTheNation and prior to the Super Bowl on @CBS at 3:30 P.M. Enjoy!

Tweet: Everyone is asking how Tiger played yesterday. The answer is Great! He was long straight &amp; putted fantastically well. He shot a 64. Tiger is back &amp; will be winning Majors again! Not surprisingly Jack also played really well. His putting is amazing! Jack &amp; Tiger like each other.

Tweet: With Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country Republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for STRONG Border Security. Dems do nothing. If there is no Wall there is no Security. Human Trafficking Drugs and Criminals of all dimensionns - KEEP OUT!

Tweet: I see Schumer is already criticizing my State of the Union speech even though he hasn’t seen it yet. He’s just upset that he didn’t win the Senate after spending a fortune like he thought he would. Too bad we weren’t given more credit for the Senate win by the media!

Tweet: The Democrats in Congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see. When the Republicans had the Majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! The Dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win!

Tweet: We have a great economy DESPITE the Obama Administration and all of its job killing Regulations and Roadblocks. If that thinking prevailed in the 2016 Election the U.S. would be in a Depression right now! We were heading down and don’t let the Democrats sound bites fool you!

Tweet: The Democrats just don’t seem to want Border Security. They are fighting Border Agents recommendations. If you believe news reports they are not offering much for the Wall. They look to be making this a campaign issue. The Wall will get built one way or the other!

Tweet: Today Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate or has she decided that after 32 years this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL Liz!

Tweet: I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called “Carbon Footprint” to permanently eliminate all Planes Cars Cows Oil Gas &amp; the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!

Tweet: Senator Richard Burr The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found NO COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA! Is anybody really surprised by this?

Tweet: Gallup Poll: “Open Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans.” This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now!

Tweet: I don’t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall &amp; now out of the blue want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!

Tweet: It was a very bad week for the Democrats with the GREAT economic numbers The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address. Now with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject!

Tweet: “President is on sound legal ground to declare a National Emergency. There have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976 and 31 right now that are currently active so this is hardly unprecedented.” Congressman @tommcclintock

Tweet: The Border Committee Democrats are behaving all of a sudden irrationally. Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts) but they don’t even want to take muderers into custody! What’s going on?

Tweet: Well it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!

Tweet: Democrats in the Senate are still slow walking hundreds of highly qualified people wanting to come into government. Never been such an abuse in our country’s history. Mitch should not let Senate go home until all are approved. We need our Ambassadors and all others NOW!

Tweet: 52% Approval Rating 93% in Republican Party ( a record )! Pretty amazing considering that 93% (also) of my press is REALLY BAD. The “people” are SMART!

Tweet: Crazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!

Tweet: President Xi of China has been very helpful in his support of my meeting with Kim Jong Un. The last thing China wants are large scale nuclear weapons right next door. Sanctions placed on the border by China and Russia have been very helpful. Great relationship with Chairman Kim!

Tweet: Chairman Kim realizes perhaps better than anyone else that without nuclear weapons his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him) it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!

Tweet: Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception only to be replaced by another beauty Cryin’ Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!

Tweet: I hope our great Republican Senators don’t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders we don’t have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart don’t fall into the Democrats “trap” of Open Borders and Crime!

Tweet: Just arrived in Vietnam. Thank you to all of the people for the great reception in Hanoi. Tremendous crowds and so much love!

Tweet: Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same and very quickly if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME a great opportunity like almost none other in history for my friend Kim Jong Un. We will know fairly soon - Very Interesting!

Tweet: The Democrats should stop talking about what I should do with North Korea and ask themselves instead why they didn’t do “it” during eight years of the Obama Administration?

Tweet: I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!

Tweet: Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying &amp; fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked’s lawyer!

Tweet: Wow just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a “love letter to Trump” manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony which now is a lie!

Tweet: Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen’s new book given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies misrepresentations and contradictions against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited!

Tweet: Michael Cohen’s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton’s lawyer Lanny Davis say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?

Tweet: The reason I do not want military drills with South Korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed. That was my position long before I became President. Also reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing!

Tweet: The military drills or war games as I call them were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NK—FAKE NEWS! I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those “games” especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost!

Tweet: “Now that the Dems are going to try &amp; switch from Collusion to some other reason it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didn’t accept the WILL OF THE PEOPLE in the last election - they will do anything to get rid of the President.” @AriFleischer It will never work!

Tweet: “Double Standard - Former FBI lawyer (Lisa Page) admits being told to go easy on Clinton.” Very unfair! @FoxNews

Tweet: “The Lisa Page (FBI) transcript also confirms earlier reporting that Page testified Russian Collusion was still unproven when Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed.” Catherine Herridge @FoxNews In other words they appointed someone when there was (and is) no crime. Bad!

Tweet: I agree with Rand Paul. This is a total disgrace and should NEVER happen to another President!

Tweet: “Democrats are frantic to throw something else at the President. That’s why you saw those 81 subpoenas. It’s ridiculous. Just because your still upset over an election that happened 2 1/2 years ago you should not be allowed to ruin people’s lives like this.” Lara Trump @FoxNews

Tweet: Just spoke to Mary Barra CEO of General Motors about the Lordstown Ohio plant. I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING. I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW Union — I don’t care I just want it open!

Tweet: Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years and do Nothing. The Dems don’t care such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border!

Tweet: FBI &amp; DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago. It is an embarrassment to our Nation!

Tweet: Congressman Adam Schiff who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking should be forced to resign from Congress!

Tweet: Wow ratings for “Morning Joe” which were really bad in the first place just “tanked” with the release of the Mueller Report. Likewise other shows on MSNBC and CNN have gone down by as much as 50%. Just shows Fake News never wins!

Tweet: We have a National Emergency at our Southern Border. The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico with the strongest immigration laws in the World refuses to help with illegal immigration &amp; drugs!

Tweet: So funny that The New York Times &amp; The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion! So they were either duped or corrupt? In any event their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!

Tweet: Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out &amp; we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!

Tweet: The Democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system. Mexico is likewise doing NOTHING a very bad combination for our Country. Homeland Security is being sooo very nice but not for long!

Tweet: Now that the long awaited Mueller Report conclusions have been released most Democrats and othershave gone back to the pre-Witch Hunt phase of their lives before Collusion Delusion took over. Others are pretending that their former hero Bob Mueller no longer exists!

Tweet: Democrats working with Republicans in Congress can fix the Asylum and other loopholes quickly. We have a major National Emergency at our Border. GET IT DONE NOW!

Tweet: Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question. Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!

Tweet: The cost of ObamaCare is far too high for our great citizens. The deductibles in many cases way over $7000 make it almost worthless or unusable. Good things are going to happen! @SenRickScott @senatemajldr @SenJohnBarrasso @SenBillCassidy

Tweet: No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report it will never be good enough. Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing!

Tweet: According to polling few people seem to care about the Russian Collusion Hoax but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the Witch Hunt alive. They should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous Collusion Delusion got started - so illegal!

Tweet: There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy. This is the highest level of Presidential Harassment in the history of our Country!

Tweet: The New York Times had no legitimate sources which would be totally illegal concerning the Mueller Report. In fact they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!

Tweet: Another Fake Story on @NBCNews that I offered Pardons to Homeland Securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. Of course this is not true. Mainstream Media is corrupt and getting worse if that is possible every day!

Tweet: In New York State Democrats blocked a Bill expanding College Tuition for Gold Star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants. No wonder so many people are leaving N.Y. Very Sad!

Tweet: Why should Radical Left Democrats in Congress have a right to retry and examine the $35000000 (two years in the making) No Collusion Mueller Report when the crime committed was by Crooked Hillary the DNC and Dirty Cops? Attorney General Barr will make the decision!

Tweet: Great playing by @TigerWoods (at the) @TheMasters. Tomorrow will be a big and exciting day for golf and for sports. Many fantastic players in the hunt. Ratings Gold - Good luck to all!

Tweet: I never offered Pardons to Homeland Security Officials never ordered anyone to close our Southern Border (although I have the absolute right to do so and may if Mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our Border) and am not “frustrated.” It is all Fake &amp; Corrupt News!

Tweet: Democrats must change the Immigration Laws FAST. If not Sanctuary Cities must immediately ACT to take care of the Illegal Immigrants - and this includes Gang Members Drug Dealers Human Traffickers and Criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds. CHANGE THE LAWS NOW!

Tweet: Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the State of California which is well known or its poor management &amp; high taxes!

Tweet: If the Fed had done its job properly which it has not the Stock Market would have been up 5000 to 10000 additional points and GDP would have been well over 4% instead of 3%...with almost no inflation. Quantitative tightening was a killer should have done the exact opposite!

Tweet: Bernie Sanders and wife should pay the Pre-Trump Taxes on their almost $600000 in income. He is always complaining about these big TAX CUTS except when it benefits him. They made a fortune off of Trump but so did everyone else - and that’s a good thing not a bad thing!

Tweet: “A very exculpatory section of the Mueller Report: NO CONSPIRACY COORDINATION or COLLUSION with the Trump Campaign and the Russians. You can’t be more clear than that!” @GreggJarrett

Tweet: Isn’t it amazing that the people who were closest to me by far and knew the Campaign better than anyone were never even called to testify before Mueller. The reason is that the 18 Angry Democrats knew they would all say ‘NO COLLUSION’ and only very good things!

Tweet: Today @FLOTUS Melania and I are honored to host the 2019 @WhiteHouse Easter Egg Roll!

Tweet: Just spoke to @LouDobbs. Will be doing a very interesting show tonight at 7:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxBusiness!

Tweet: PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!

Tweet: Paul Krugman of the Fake News New York Times has lost all credibility as has the Times itself with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash Only Record Highs!

Tweet: I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger &amp; better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees &amp; beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!

Tweet: I will be going to Green Bay Wisconsin for a really big Rally on Saturday Evening. Big crowd expected much to talk about. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: The Radical Left Democrats together with their leaders in the Fake News Media have gone totally insane! I guess that means that the Republican agenda is working. Stay tuned for more!

Tweet: In the “old days” if you were President and you had a good economy you were basically immune from criticism. Remember “It’s the economy stupid.” Today I have as President perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media it means NOTHING. But it will!

Tweet: “Harley Davidson has struggled with Tariffs with the EU currently paying 31%. They’ve had to move production overseas to try and offset some of that Tariff that they’ve been hit with which will rise to 66% in June of 2021.” @MariaBartiromo So unfair to U.S. We will Reciprocate!

Tweet: Thanks Rush! @FoxNews

Tweet: “Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson accuses United Kingdom Intelligence of helping Obama Administration Spy on the 2016 Trump Presidential Campaign.” @OANN WOW! It is now just a question of time before the truth comes out and when it does it will be a beauty!

Tweet: The American people deserve to know who is in this Country. Yesterday the Supreme Court took up the Census Citizenship question a really big deal. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: A very big Caravan of over 20000 people started up through Mexico. It has been reduced in size by Mexico but is still coming. Mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the Border &amp; call up the Military. The Coyotes &amp; Cartels have weapons!

Tweet: Mexico’s Soldiers recently pulled guns on our National Guard Soldiers probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the Border. Better not happen again! We are now sending ARMED SOLDIERS to the Border. Mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending &amp; returning!

Tweet: Can anyone comprehend what a GREAT job Border Patrol and Law Enforcement is doing on our Southern Border. So far this year they have APPREHENDED 418000 plus illegal immigrants way up from last year. Mexico is doing very little for us. DEMS IN CONGRESS MUST ACT NOW!

Tweet: I didn’t call Bob Costa of the Washington Post he called me (Returned his call)! Just more Fake News.

Tweet: Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence long in doubt to wage a successful primary campaign. It will be nasty - you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick &amp; demented ideas. But if you make it I will see you at the Starting Gate!

Tweet: I will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 PM on @FoxNews. Enjoy!

Tweet: I will be interviewed on @seanhannity at 9:00 PM. In 5 minutes - Enjoy!

Tweet: No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier not two Million Dollars not anything else. This is not the Obama Administration that paid 1.8 Billion Dollars for four hostages or gave five terroist hostages plus who soon went back to battle for traitor Sgt. Bergdahl!

Tweet: “President Donald J. Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States. 20 hostages many in impossible circumstances have been released in last two years. No money was paid.” Cheif Hostage Negotiator USA!

Tweet: Weirdo Tom Steyer who didn’t have the “guts” or money to run for President is still trying to remain relevant by putting himself on ads begging for impeachment. He doesn’t mention the fact that mine is perhaps the most successful first 2 year presidency in history &amp; NO C OR O!

Tweet: Heading to Indianapolis to speak at the big NRA Conference. Love being in Indiana. The @NRA is getting stronger &amp; stronger and doing some really great and important work. Having their powerful support has been vital to #MAGA!

Tweet: Just out: Real GDP for First Quarter grew 3.2% at an annual rate. This is far above expectations or projections. Importantly inflation VERY LOW. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Great NRA crowd and enthusiasm in Indiana. Thank you! Leaving now for meetings in the Oval Office.

Tweet: Spoke to Saudi Arabia and others about increasing oil flow. All are in agreement. The California tax on gasoline is causing big problems on pricing for that state. Speak to your Governor about reducing. Economic numbers 3.2% GDP for what is often worst quarter looking good!

Tweet: “U.S. Economy Grows 3.2% in Q1 Smashing Expectations”

Tweet: THANK YOU @NRA! #NRAAM

Tweet: I spoke at length yesterday to Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein Chabad of Poway where I extended my warmest condolences to him and all affected by the shooting in California. What a great guy. He had a least one finger blown off and all he wanted to do is help others. Very special!

Tweet: The NRA is under siege by Cuomo and the New York State A.G. who are illegally using the State’s legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization &amp; others. It must get its act together quickly stop the internal fighting &amp; get back to GREATNESS - FAST!

Tweet: I’ll never get the support of Dues Crazy union leadership those people who rip-off their membership with ridiculously high dues medical and other expenses while being paid a fortune. But the members love Trump. They look at our record economy tax &amp; reg cuts military etc. WIN!

Tweet: The Media (Fake News) is pushing Sleepy Joe hard. Funny I’m only here because of Biden &amp; Obama. They didn’t do the job and now you have Trump who is getting it done - big time!

Tweet: The Dues Sucking firefighters leadership will always support Democrats even though the membership wants me. Some things never change!

Tweet: Bob Mueller was a great HERO to the Radical Left Democrats. Now that the Mueller Report is finished with a finding of NO COLLUSION &amp; NO OBSTRUCTION (based on a review of Report by our highly respected A.G.) the Dems are going around saying “Bob who sorry don’t know the man.”

Tweet: The New York Times has apologized for the terrible Anti-Semitic Cartoon but they haven’t apologized to me for this or all of the Fake and Corrupt news they print on a daily basis. They have reached the lowest level of “journalism” and certainly a low point in @nytimes history!

Tweet: Pittsburgh jobless rate hits lowest point since the early 1970s (maybe even better than that) and Sleepy Joe just had his first rally there. Fact is every economic aspect of our Country is the best it has ever been!

Tweet: The Coyotes and Drug Cartels are in total control of the Mexico side of the Southern Border. They have labs nearby where they make drugs to sell into the U.S. Mexico one of the most dangerous country’s in the world must eradicate this problem now. Also stop the MARCH to U.S.

Tweet: If the Democrats don’t give us the votes to change our weak ineffective and dangerous Immigration Laws we must fight hard for these votes in the 2020 Election!

Tweet: I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!

Tweet: “The Democrats can’t come to grips with the fact that there was No Collusion there was No Conspiracy there was No Obstruction. What we should be focused on is what’s been going on in our government at the highest levels of the FBI....” Senator Josh Hawley

Tweet: I am overriding the Decommission Order of the magnificent aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman built in 1998 (fairly new) and considered one of the largest and finest in the world. It will be updated at a fraction of the cost of a new one (which also are being built)!

Tweet: Gallup Poll: 56% of Americans rate their financial situation as excellent or good. This is the highest number since 2002 and up 10 points since 2016.

Tweet: “No President in history has endured such vicious personal attacks by political opponents. Still the President’s record is unparalleled.” @LouDobbs

Tweet: Congress must change the Immigration Laws now Dems won’t act. Wall is being built - 400 miles by end of next year. Mexico must stop the march to Border! @foxandfriends

Tweet: Why didn’t President Obama do something about Russia in September (before November Election) when told by the FBI? He did NOTHING and had no intention of doing anything!

Tweet: NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION. Besides how can you have Obstruction when not only was there No Collusion (by Trump) but the bad actions were done by the “other” side? The greatest con-job in the history of American Politics!

Tweet: I am continuing to monitor the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!

Tweet: The Collusion Delusion is OVER!

Tweet: The Mueller Witch Hunt is completely OVER! @SeanHannity

Tweet: Proclamation on Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust:

Tweet: Thank you working hard! #MAGA

Tweet: Finally Mainstream Media is getting involved - too “hot” to avoid. Pulitzer Prize anyone? The New York Times on front page (finally) “Details effort to spy on Trump Campaign.” @foxandfriends This is bigger than WATERGATE but the reverse!

Tweet: JOBS JOBS JOBS!“Jobs surge in April unemployment rate falls to the lowest since 1969”

Tweet: “The U.S. Created 263000 Jobs in April Unemployment Fell to Lowest Level Since 1969”

Tweet: We can all agree that AMERICA is now #1. We are the ENVY of the WORLD — and the best is yet to come!

Tweet: Fred Keller of the Great State of Pennsylvania has been an outstanding State Rep. Now he is running as the Republican Nominee for Congress and has my Complete and Total Endorsement. Strong on Crime Second Amendment Military Vets and Healthcare. He will do a fantastic job!

Tweet: The International Association of Firefighters Union is rebelling on their very foolish leader. Perhaps they will vote him out of office. He doesn’t get it!

Tweet: I am continuing to monitor the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms. This is the United States of America — and we have what’s known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH! We are monitoring and watching closely!!

Tweet: The wonderful Diamond and Silk have been treated so horribly by Facebook. They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad - and we’re looking into. It’s getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!

Tweet: So surprised to see Conservative thinkers like James Woods banned from Twitter and Paul Watson banned from Facebook!

Tweet: As the great people of IA IL &amp; MO continue to confront the devastating flooding know we are here for you and ready to help! My team remains in close contact with @IAGovernor @GovParsonMO @GovPritzker and the local officials managing the impacts of the destructive flooding.

Tweet: “They wanted to know what Trump was up to with the Russians - which of course is nonsense. This whole thing was a complete setup.” George Papadopoulos to @seanhannity

Tweet: There is nothing easy about a USA Infrastructure Plan especially when our great Country has spent an astounding 7 trillion dollars in the Middle East over the last 19 years but I am looking hard at a bipartisan plan of 1 to 2 trillion dollars. Badly needed!

Tweet: So great to watch this!

Tweet: When will the Radical Left Wing Media apologize to me for knowingly getting the Russia Collusion Delusion story so wrong? The real story is about to happen! Why is @nytimes @washingtonpost @CNN @MSNBC allowed to be on Twitter &amp; Facebook. Much of what they do is FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: Anything in this very interesting world is possible but I believe that Kim Jong Un fully realizes the great economic potential of North Korea &amp; will do nothing to interfere or end it. He also knows that I am with him &amp; does not want to break his promise to me. Deal will happen!

Tweet: Very good call yesterday with President Putin of Russia. Tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia despite what you read and see in the Fake News Media. Look how they have misled you on “Russia Collusion.” The World can be a better and safer place. Nice!

Tweet: Today May 4th - is International Firefighters Day! We remember all of those who put their lives on the line to save others and are grateful to those who continue to do so 24/7/365. We love our great firefighters thank you! #ThankAFirefighter

Tweet: How can it be possible that James Woods (and many others) a strong but responsible Conservative Voice is banned from Twitter? Social Media &amp; Fake News Media together with their partner the Democrat Party have no idea the problems they are causing for themselves. VERY UNFAIR!

Tweet: Mike has been a fantastic Senator!

Tweet: The Kentuky Derby decision was not a good one. It was a rough and tumble race on a wet and sloppy track actually a beautiful thing to watch. Only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur. The best horse did NOT win the Kentucky Derby - not even close!

Tweet: I am pleased to inform all of those that believe in a strong fair and sound Immigration Policy that Mark Morgan will be joining the Trump Administration as the head of our hard working men and women of ICE. Mark is a true believer and American Patriot. He will do a great job!

Tweet: The Kentucky Derby decision was not a good one. It was a rough &amp; tumble race on a wet and sloppy track actually a beautiful thing to watch. Only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur. The best horse did NOT win the Kentucky Derby - not even close!

Tweet: “The Report sounded an awful lot as being Comeyesque in other words I’m not going to charge this person (there wasn’t even close to being a crime) but I’m going to criticize him on the way out the door. That’s unfortunate because it’s stepping outside of the role.” Robert Ray

Tweet: “This is not Congressional Oversight this is bullying.” Jason Riley The Wall Street Journal

Tweet: Pending the confirmation of Mark Morgan as our Nation’s new ICE Director Matt Albence will serve in the role of Acting Director. Matt is tough and dedicated and has my full support to deploy ICE to the maximum extent of the law! #MAGA

Tweet: Also there are “No High Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors” No Collusion No Conspiracy No Obstruction. ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE and that’s what the Dems should be looking at but they won’t. Nevertheless the tables are turning!

Tweet: The United States has been losing for many years 600 to 800 Billion Dollars a year on Trade. With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars. Sorry we’re not going to be doing that anymore!

Tweet: Scott Walker is 100% correct when he says that the Republicans must WAKE UP to the Democrats State by State power grab. They play very dirty actually like never before. Don’t allow them to get away with what they are doing!

Tweet: Just spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan concerning North Korea and Trade. Very good conversation!

Tweet: Congratulations

Tweet: Today it was my true honor to present the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy—for the second year in a row to the @ArmyWP_Football Black Knights. Congratulations once again on your historic victories and keep on making us proud!

Tweet: “This British Spy Christopher Steele tried so hard to get this (the Fake Dossier) out before the Election. Why?” @kilmeade @foxandfriends

Tweet: Republicans shouldn’t vote for H.R. 312 a special interest casino Bill backed by Elizabeth (Pocahontas) Warren. It is unfair and doesn’t treat Native Americans equally!

Tweet: James Comey is a disgrace to the FBI &amp; will go down as the worst Director in its long and once proud history. He brought the FBI down almost all Republicans &amp; Democrats thought he should be FIRED but the FBI will regain greatness because of the great men &amp; women who work there!

Tweet: Republicans must stick together!

Tweet: Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also much easier &amp; quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source!

Tweet: Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER not weaker. Just sit back and watch! In the meantime China should not renegotiate deals with the U.S. at the last minute. This is not the Obama Administration or the Administration of Sleepy Joe who let China get away with “murder!”

Tweet: The average 401(k) balance has SOARED since the bottom of the market - 466%. Wow!

Tweet: Such an easy way to avoid Tariffs? Make or produce your goods and products in the good old USA. It’s very simple!

Tweet: I won the 2016 Election partially based on no Tax Returns while I am under audit (which I still am) and the voters didn’t care. Now the Radical Left Democrats want to again relitigate this matter. Make it a part of the 2020 Election!

Tweet: So now the Radical Left Dems don’t talk about Collusion anymore because the Mueller Report said there was No Collusion they only want to talk about Obstruction even though there was No Obstruction or No Crime - except for the crimes committed by the other side!

Tweet: I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!

Tweet: Big attacks on Republicans and Conservatives by Social Media. Not good!

Tweet: Really sad!

Tweet: Despite two years and millions of dollars spent the Democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the Mueller Report were made public. But they knew there was NOTHING even before the Report was started. It is all a big Hoax the biggest in American history!

Tweet: Ever since the Mueller Report showed No Collusion &amp; No Obstruction the Dems have been working overtime to damage me and the Republican Party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies and with NO REASON. That’s all they want to do - don’t care about anything else!

Tweet: When the Mueller Report came out showing NO Collusion with Russia (of course) it was supposed to be over back to work for the people. But the Dems have gone “nuts” and it has actually gotten worse! Hope the Republicans win back the House in 2020 or little will get done!

Tweet: The “Constitutional Crisis” is the Democrats refusing to work. Let them start by fixing the mess that their Immigration Laws have caused at the Southern Border.

Tweet: I say openly to President Xi &amp; all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don’t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries. Too expensive to buy in China. You had a great deal almost completed &amp; you backed out!

Tweet: Thank you @foxandfriends great show this morning and congratulations on your number one (by far) rating. Well deserved!

Tweet: Also congratulations to @OANN on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump (“thank you President Trump”)!

Tweet: The unexpectedly good first quarter 3.2% GDP was greatly helped by Tariffs from China. Some people just don’t get it!

Tweet: Has anyone noticed that all the Boston @RedSox have done is WIN since coming to the White House! Others also have done very well. The White House visit is becoming the opposite of being on the cover of Sports Illustrated! By the way the Boston players were GREAT guys!

Tweet: Bernie Sanders “The Economy is doing well and I’m sure I don’t have to give Trump any credit - I’m sure he’ll take all the credit that he wants.” Wrong Bernie the Economy is doing GREAT and would have CRASHED if my opponent (and yours) Crooked Hillary Clinton had ever won!

Tweet: Democrat Rep. Tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust. She obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people. Can you imagine what would happen if I ever said what she said and says?

Tweet: In one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry - it is booming! We placed a 25% Tariff on “dumped” steel from China &amp; other countries and we now have a big and growing industry. We had to save Steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong!

Tweet: Billions of Dollars and moving jobs back to the USA where they belong. Other countries are already negotiating with us because they don’t want this to happen to them. They must be a part of USA action. This should have been done by our leaders many years ago. Enjoy!

Tweet: The Dems are getting another beauty to join their group. Bill de Blasio of NYC considered the worst mayor in the U.S. will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE but if you like high taxes &amp; crime he’s your man. NYC HATES HIM!

Tweet: Congratulations to Dan Bishop on his big Republican Primary victory in the 9th Congressional District of North Carolina. Dan is strong on Crime Loves our Military Vets 2A and great Healthcare. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement! #MAGA

Tweet: .@BilldeBlasio is the worst Mayor in the history of New York City - he won’t last long!

Tweet: The Democrats now realize that there is a National Emergency at the Border and that if we work together it can be immediately fixed. We need Democrat votes and all will be well!

Tweet: Border Patrol is apprehending record numbers of people at the Southern Border. The bad “hombres” of which there are many are being detained &amp; will be sent home. Those which we release under the ridiculous Catch &amp; Telease loophole are being registered and will be removed later!

Tweet: All people that are illegally coming into the United States now will be removed from our Country at a later date as we build up our removal forces and as the laws are changed. Please do not make yourselves too comfortable you will be leaving soon!

Tweet: My Campaign for President was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American Politics. A really bad situation. TREASON means long jail sentences and this was TREASON!

Tweet: Will Jerry Nadler ever look into the fact that Crooked Hillary deleted and acid washed 33000 emails AFTER getting a most powerful demand notice for them from Congress?

Tweet: The Fake News Media is hurting our Country with its fraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of Iran. It is scattershot poorly sourced (made up) and DANGEROUS. At least Iran doesn’t know what to think which at this point may very well be a good thing!

Tweet: It now seems the General Flynn was under investigation long before was common knowledge. It would have been impossible for me to know this but if that was the case and with me being one of two people who would become president why was I not told so that I could make a change?

Tweet: With all of the Fake and Made Up News out there Iran can have no idea what is actually going on!

Tweet: Watched some of the Fake News Political Shows this morning and continue to be amazed at how every question is asked in the most negative way. The Mainstream Media should be ashamed of itself - But the good news is that the USA is wise to your game of dishonesty and deception!

Tweet: I will be interviewed by Steve Hilton tonight at 8:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Enjoy!

Tweet: The Mainstream Media hates to cover this!

Tweet: The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years) and others of the Fake News Media keep writing phony stories about how I didn’t use many banks because they didn’t want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didn’t need money. Very old

Tweet: Two Tweets missing from last batch probably a Twitter error. No time for a redo! Only the Dems get redos!

Tweet: “We have a booming economy and working people are making gains that they haven’t seen in decades.” Stuart Varney @foxandfriends

Tweet: Why are the Democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by Crooked Hillary and the phony Russia Investigation? They would get back their credibility. Jerry Nadler Schiff would have a whole new future open to them. Perhaps they could even run for President!

Tweet: Looks like Bernie Sanders is history. Sleepy Joe Biden is pulling ahead and think about it I’m only here because of Sleepy Joe and the man who took him off the 1% trash heap President O! China wants Sleepy Joe BADLY!

Tweet: On this Cuban Independence Day we stand by the people of Cuba in their quest for freedom democracy and prosperity. The Cuban regime must end its repression of Cubans &amp; Venezuelans. The United States will not stand idly by as Cuba continues to subvert democracy in the Americas!

Tweet: Shahira Knight has done a wonderful job as my Legislative Affairs Director at the White House. She was outstanding for us and for our Country - will be a tremendous success in the private sector!

Tweet: After spending 40 Million Dollars reviewing 1.4 million pages of documents &amp; interviewing 500 people with the total support of the White House the Mueller Report was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT to the Democrats so they want a DO OVER. It doesn’t work that way-so bad for our Country!

Tweet: The Democrats are on a fishing expedition wanting to interview the same people and see the same things as we just went through for two years with Robert Mueller and the 18 Angry Dems. Never happened to a president before. Never even happened to President Obama!

Tweet: John Brennan on the Mueller probe “I don’t know if I received bad information but I THINK I SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN THERE ACTUALLY WAS.” Wow he admits he was wrong! Congress should go back to work on drug prices etc.

Tweet: Great news for Republicans: Fred Keller has just won the hard fought for Pennsylvania Congressional contest in a LANDSLIDE over 70% of the vote. Thanks to the thousands who showed up for the Rally last night. Congratulations to Fred and his wonderful family!

Tweet: Congratulations to Governor @MattBevin on winning the Republican Primary for Governor tonight in the Great State of KENTUCKY. Matt you are doing a fantastic job!

Tweet: Everything the Democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them especially when the Mueller Report came back with a NO COLLUSION finding. Now they say Impeach President Trump even though he did nothin wrong while they “fish!”

Tweet: After two years of an expensive and comprehensive Witch Hunt the Democrats don’t like the result and they want a DO OVER. In other words the Witch Hunt continues!

Tweet: The Democrats are getting ZERO work done in Congress. All they are focused on is trying to prove the Mueller Report wrong the Witch Hunt!

Tweet: PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!

Tweet: Without the ILLEGAL Witch Hunt my poll numbers especially because of our historically “great” economy would be at 65%. Too bad! The greatest Hoax in American History.

Tweet: Also tremendous work is being done on pure renovation - fixing existing Walls that are in bad condition and ineffective and bringing them to a very high standard!

Tweet: Everybody including me thought that when the 40 Million Dollar Mueller Report was released with No Collusion and No Obstruction (of a crime caused by others) that was the end. But no the Democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020. Bad for the Country!

Tweet: “The Democrats are in danger of becoming irrelevant because of their decision to keep taking the country on wild goose chases. They ought to start governing. You know for a change.” Michael Goodwin @newyorkpost

Tweet: As I have long been saying and has now been proven out this is a Witch Hunt against the Republican Party and myself and it was the other side that caused the problem not us!

Tweet: I want to welcome you all to the @WhiteHouse as we award our very bravest law enforcement officers and firefighters our nation’s highest public safety award – The Medal of

Tweet: In a letter to her House colleagues Nancy Pelosi said: “President Trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see.” This is not true. I was purposely very polite and calm much as I was minutes later with the press in the Rose Garden. Can be easily proven. It is all such a lie!

Tweet: Zero is getting done with the Democrats in charge of the House. All they want to do is put the Mueller Report behind them and start all over again. No Do-Overs!

Tweet: Democrats don’t want to fix the loopholes at the Border. They don’t want to do anything. Open Borders and crime!

Tweet: The Democrats have become known as THE DO NOTHING PARTY!

Tweet: Rex Tillerson a man who is “dumb as a rock” and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be Secretary of State made up a story (he got fired) that I was out-prepared by Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Hamburg Germany. I don’t think Putin would agree. Look how the U.S. is doing!

Tweet: I was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with Pelosi and Schumer knowing that they would say I was raging which they always do along with their partner the Fake News Media. Well so many stories about the meeting use the Rage narrative anyway - Fake &amp; Corrupt Press!

Tweet: When the Democrats in Congress refinish for the 5th time their Fake work on their very disappointing Mueller Report finding they will have the time to get the REAL work of the people done. Move quickly!

Tweet: Our hearts go out to the people of Missouri as they woke up to assess the damage from storms. You are strong and resilient and we are here to assist.

Tweet: The U.S. Senate has just approved a 19 Billion Dollar Disaster Relief Bill with my total approval. Great!

Tweet: @FoxNews Poll: A majority of Americans want the Democrats to stop investigating President Trump. The Mueller Report said very strongly NO COLLUSION which led to NO OBSTRUCTION. The Dems can’t get over 2016 or the conclusive Mueller findings. They are now the Do Nothing Party!

Tweet: “Nancy Pelosi should not be out there doing the kinds of things she is doing. She will diminish herself and her membership. She cannot put a subject with a predicate in the same sentence. What’s going on?” Ed Rollins @GreggJarrett @LouDobbs

Tweet: “PELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE”

Tweet: 71% of Voters rate the Economy as Excellent or Good. The highest number in more than 18 years! @QuinnipiacPoll

Tweet: Wow! CNN Ratings are WAY DOWN record lows. People are getting tired of so many Fake Stories and Anti-Trump lies. Chris Cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot - which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television Don Lemon!

Tweet: When is Twitter going to allow the very popular Conservative Voices that it has so viciously shut down back into the OPEN? IT IS TIME!

Tweet: “Intelligence Agencies were used against an American President.” @DevinNunes @ShannonBream @FoxNews This should NEVER happen to a President again! Dems are furious at Robert Mueller for his findings - NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION. Now they should go back to work and legislate!

Tweet: “If they try to Impeach President Trump who has done nothing wrong (No Collusion) they will end up getting him re-elected” @LindseyGrahamSC Impeachment is for High Crimes and Misdemeanors. There were no High Crimes and Misdemeanors except for those committed by the other side!

Tweet: I don’t know why the Radical Left Democrats want Bob Mueller to testify when he just issued a 40 Million Dollar Report that states loud &amp; clear &amp; for all to hear No Collusion and No Obstruction (how do you Obstruct a NO crime?) Dems are just looking for trouble and a Do-Over!

Tweet: Congratulations to Tom Cotton - his book “Sacred Duty: A Solider’s Tour at Arlington National Cemetery” just hit the best sellers list. I was at @ArlingtonNatl yesterday &amp; the people there were so grateful for Tom’s inspiring portrait of “The Old Guard.” Great job @TomCottonAR!

Tweet: The real trade war began 30 years ago and we lost. This is a bright new Age the Age of Enlightenment. We don’t lose anymore!

Tweet: Democrat Senator Mark Warner is acting and talking like he is in total control of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Their is nothing bipartisan about him. He should not be allowed to take “command” of that Committee. Too important! Remember when he spoke to the Russian jokester?

Tweet: Can’t believe that Rolling Thunder would be given a hard time with permits in Washington D.C. They are great Patriots who I have gotten to know and see in action. They love our Country and love our Flag. If I can help I will!

Tweet: Getting ready to land in Japan with First Lady Melania. We look forward to seeing everyone soon!🇺🇸🇯🇵

Tweet: Another activist Obama appointed judge has just ruled against us on a section of the Southern Wall that is already under construction. This is a ruling against Border Security and in favor of crime drugs and human trafficking. We are asking for an expedited appeal!

Tweet: Thank you John so nice!

Tweet: In addition to great incompetence and corruption The Smollett case in Chicago is also about a Hate Crime. Remember “MAGA COUNTRY DID IT!” That turned out to be a total lie had nothing to do with “MAGA COUNTRY.” Serious stuff and not even an apology to millions of people!

Tweet: North Korea fired off some small weapons which disturbed some of my people and others but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me &amp; also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Bidan a low IQ individual &amp; worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?

Tweet: Going to play golf right now with @AbeShinzo. Japan loves the game. Tremendous fans of @JackNicklaus @TigerWoods and @PhilMickelson — I said what about @GaryPlayer they said we love Gary too!

Tweet: Great morning of golf with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo at Mobara Country Club in Chiba Japan!

Tweet: Great fun and meeting with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo. Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed - Death Wish!

Tweet: Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!

Tweet: “Why doesn’t the press apologize to President Trump for the Russian Collusion Delusion?” @marklevinshow @JudgeJeanine How about the Dems also?

Tweet: The Great Patriots of Rolling Thunder WILL be coming back to Washington D.C. next year &amp; hopefully for many years to come. It is where they want to be &amp; where they should be. Have a wonderful time today. Thank you to our great men &amp; women of the Pentagon for working it out!

Tweet: Congratulations to the Great (and my friend) Roger Penske on winning his 18th (UNBELIEVABLE!) Indianapolis 500. I am in Japan very early in the morning but I got to watch Simon drive one of the greatest races in the history of the sport. I will see them both &amp; TEAM at the WH!

Tweet: Great evening last night thank you!

Tweet: .@ianbremmer now admits that he MADE UP “a completely ludicrous quote” attributing it to me. This is what’s going on in the age of Fake News. People think they can say anything and get away with it. Really the libel laws should be changed to hold Fake News Media accountable!

Tweet: Impeach for what having created perhaps the greatest Economy in our Country’s history rebuilding our Military taking care of our Vets (Choice) Judges Best Jobs Numbers Ever and much more? Dems are Obstructionists!

Tweet: The Dems are getting NOTHING done in Congress! They only want a Do-Over on Mueller!

Tweet: Liz Cheney: Statements by agents investigating Trump 'could well be treason'

Tweet: Hoping things will work out with Israel's coalition formation and Bibi and I can continue to make the alliance between America and Israel stronger than ever. A lot more to do!

Tweet: Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular African Americans will not be ble to vote for you. I on the other hand was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform which had tremendous support and helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!

Tweet: Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I on the other hand was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform which had tremendous support &amp; helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!

Tweet: Just spoke to Governor @AsaHutchinson of the Great State of Arkansas to inform him that FEMA and the Federal Government will do whatever is necessary to help out with what has turned out to be Record Flooding. Asa and local officials are doing a great job!

Tweet: I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil. Kim Jong Un called him a “low IQ idiot” and many other things whereas I related the quote of Chairman Kim as a much softer “low IQ individual.” Who could possibly be upset with that?

Tweet: Back from Japan after a very successful trip. Big progress on MANY fronts. A great country with a wonderful leader in Prime Minister Abe!

Tweet: THANK YOU JAPAN!🇺🇸🇯🇵

Tweet: Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore in our Country a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.

Tweet: How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? WITCH-HUNT!

Tweet: Great show tonight @seanhannity you really get it (9:00 P.M. @FoxNews) that’s why you’re Number One (by far)! Also please tell Mark Levin congrats on having the Number One book!

Tweet: I was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan. Nevertheless @FLOTUS and I loved being with our great Military Men and Women - what a spectacular job they do!

Tweet: The Greatest Presidential Harassment in history. After spending $40000000 over two dark years with unlimited access people resources and cooperation highly conflicted Robert Mueller would have brought charges if he had ANYTHING but there were no charges to bring!

Tweet: Congressman John Ratcliffe “The Trump Campaign clearly did not conspire or collude.” @FoxNews

Tweet: “Comey and Brennan are turning on each other.” @kilmeade

Tweet: Robert Mueller came to the Oval Office (along with other potential candidates) seeking to be named the Director of the FBI. He had already been in that position for 12 years I told him NO. The next day he was named Special Counsel - A total Conflict of Interest. NICE!

Tweet: Very sad to hear the news on the passing of my friend Senator Thad Cochran. He was a real Senator with incredible values - even flew back to Senate from Mississippi for important Healthcare Vote when he was desperately ill. Thad never let our Country (or me) down!

Tweet: Just arrived in Colorado. Getting ready to deliver the commencement speech at the Air Force Academy graduation. Very exciting - probably will be broadcast live on TV. They want good ratings!

Tweet: Yesterday Border Patrol agents apprehended the largest group of illegal aliens ever: 1036 people who illegally crossed the border in El Paso around 4am. Democrats need to stand by our incredible Border Patrol and finally fix the loopholes at our Border!

Tweet: The Navy put out a disclaimer on the McCain story. Looks like the story was an exaggeration or even Fake News - but why not everything else is!

Tweet: I will be watching @AlanDersh on @IngrahamAngle at 10:00 P.M. He speaks the truth!

Tweet: Sean Davis The Federalist: “Mueller proved his entire operation was a political hit job. Still ZERO evidence of Trump-Russia Collusion and no new evidence from Mueller.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews

Tweet: Congratulations to the @AF_Academy Class of 2019!

Tweet: Hard to believe that with the Crisis on the Border the Dems won’t do the quick and easy fix. Would solve the problem but they want Open Borders which equals crime!

Tweet: Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades. Because of the Dems our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S. have for decades they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!

Tweet: In order not to pay Tariffs if they start rising companies will leave Mexico which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry and come back home to the USA. Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals!

Tweet: 90% of the Drugs coming into the United States come through Mexico &amp; our Southern Border. 80000 people died last year 1000000 people ruined. This has gone on for many years &amp; nothing has been done about it. We have a 100 Billion Dollar Trade Deficit with Mexico. It’s time!

Tweet: Saddened to hear about the loss of John Pinto a Navajo Code Talker in World War II over the Memorial Day Weekend. The Code Talkers are true American HEROES and John never stopped serving his fellow citizens as a longtime New Mexico State Senator. John Rest In Peace!

Tweet: The Great Jerry West will be receiving our Nation’s highest civilian honor The Presidential Medal of Freedom for his outstanding career both on and off the court. Happy Birthday Jerry! @Sen_JoeManchin

Tweet: The Democrats are doing nothing on the Border to address the Humanitarian and National Security Crisis! Could be fixed so easily if they would vote with Republicans to fix the loopholes.

Tweet: The Wall is under construction and moving along quickly despite all of the Radical Liberal Democrat lawsuits. What are they thinking as our Country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (Drugs) that we do not want. Make America Great Again!

Tweet: NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION NO NOTHING! “What the Democrats are trying to do is the biggest sin in the impeachment business.” David Rivkin Constitutional Scholar. Meantime the Dems are getting nothing done in Congress. They are frozen stiff. Get back to work much to do!

Tweet: I never called Meghan Markle “nasty.” Made up by the Fake News Media and they got caught cold! Will @CNN @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it!

Tweet: Peggy Noonan the simplistic writer for Trump Haters all is stuck in the past glory of Reagan and has no idea what is happening with the Radical Left Democrats or how vicious and desperate they are. Mueller had to correct his ridiculous statement Peggy never understood it!

Tweet: Mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the Border. Problem is they’ve been “talking” for 25 years. We want action not talk. They could solve the Border Crisis in one day if they so desired. Otherwise our companies and jobs are coming back to the USA!

Tweet: Democrats can’t impeach a Republican President for crimes committed by Democrats. The facts are “pouring” in. The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History! Congress go back to work and help us at the Border with Drug Prices and on Infrastructure.

Tweet: Hearing word that Russia Syria and to a lesser extent Iran are bombing the hell out of Idlib Province in Syria and indiscriminately killing many innocent civilians. The World is watching this butchery. What is the purpose what will it get you? STOP!

Tweet: Kevin Hassett who has done such a great job for me and the Administration will be leaving shortly. His very talented replacement will be named as soon as I get back to the U.S. I want to thank Kevin for all he has done - he is a true friend!

Tweet: BIG NEWS! As I promised two weeks ago the first shipment of LNG has just left the Cameron LNG Export Facility in Louisiana. Not only have thousands of JOBS been created in USA we’re shipping freedom and opportunity abroad!

Tweet: China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries including the United States in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation but U.S. is taking Billions!

Tweet: Just arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that @CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S. After watching it for a short while I turned it off. All negative &amp; so much Fake News very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop. Why doesn’t owner @ATT do something?

Tweet: I believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ATT they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN which is dying in the ratings anyway. It is so unfair with such bad Fake News! Why wouldn’t they act. When the World watches @CNN it gets a false picture of USA. Sad!

Tweet: Russia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from Venezuela.

Tweet: As a sign of good faith Mexico should immediately stop the flow of people and drugs through their country and to our Southern Border. They can do it if they want!

Tweet: House just passed the 19.1 Billion Dollar Disaster Aid Bill. Great now we will get it done in the Senate! Farmers Puerto Rico and all will be very happy.

Tweet: Thank you @Theresa_May!🇺🇸🇬🇧

Tweet: Just had a big victory in Federal Court over the Democrats in the House on the desperately needed Border Wall. A big step in the right direction. Wall is under construction!

Tweet: Can you imagine Cryin’ Chuck Schumer saying out loud for all to hear that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep. He would rather have our Country fail with drugs &amp; Immigration than give Republicans a win. But he gave Mexico bad advice no bluff!

Tweet: Washed up psycho @BetteMidler was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make “your great president” look really bad. She got caught just like the Fake News Media gets caught. A sick scammer!

Tweet: #USStateVisit🇺🇸🇬🇧

Tweet: Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem but the Corrupt Media will save him. His other problem is that he is drawing flies not people to his Rallies. Nobody is showing up I mean nobody. You can’t win without people!

Tweet: I kept hearing that there would be “massive” rallies against me in the UK but it was quite the opposite. The big crowds which the Corrupt Media hates to show were those that gathered in support of the USA and me. They were big &amp; enthusiastic as opposed to the organized flops!

Tweet: If the totally Corrupt Media was less corrupt I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy maybe Best Ever! If the Corrup Media was actually fair I would be up by 25 points. Nevertheless despite the Fake News we’re doing great!

Tweet: .@FLOTUS Melania and I send our deepest condolences to President Reuven Rivlin and the entire State of Israel upon the passing of Mrs. Nechama Rivlin. Mrs. Rivlin represented her beloved country with grace and stature. We will miss her along with all those who knew her.

Tweet: Could not have been treated more warmly in the United Kingdom by the Royal Family or the people. Our relationship has never been better and I see a very big Trade Deal down the road. “This trip has been an incredible success for the President.” @IngrahamAngle

Tweet: House Democrats fresh off a Republican victory against them (in Federal Court) on the Wall keep asking people to come and testify regarding the No Collusion Witch Hunt. They are very unhappy with the Mueller Report especially with his corrective letter &amp; now want a Do Over!

Tweet: If the totally Corrupt Media was less corrupt I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy maybe Best Ever! If the Corrupt Media was actually fair I would be up by 25 points. Nevertheless despite the Fake News we’re doing great!

Tweet: “House Republicans support the President on Tariffs with Mexico all the way &amp; that makes any measure the President takes on the Border totally Veto proof. Why wouldn’t you as Republicans support him when that will allow our President to make a better deal.” Thank you @GOPLeader

Tweet: China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries including the United States in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation but U.S. is taking in Billions!

Tweet: If we are able to make the deal with Mexico &amp; there is a good chance that we will they will begin purchasing Farm &amp; Agricultural products at very high levels starting immediately. If we are unable to make the deal Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!

Tweet: Democrats are incapable of doing a good and solid Immigration Bill!

Tweet: For all of the money we are spending NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago. They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing including Mars (of which the Moon is a part) Defense and Science!

Tweet: Dow Jones has best week of the year!

Tweet: While the reviews and reporting on our Border Immigration Agreement with Mexico have been very good there has nevertheless been much false reporting (surprise!) by the Fake and Corrupt News Media such as Comcast/NBC CNN @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost. These “Fakers” are Bad News!

Tweet: Brandon Judd National Border Patrol Council: “That’s going to be a huge deal because Mexico will be using their strong Immigration Laws - A game changer. People no longer will be released into the U.S.” Also 6000 Mexican Troops at their Southern Border. Currently there are few!

Tweet: Mexico will try very hard and if they do that this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!

Tweet: MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!

Tweet: Nervous Nancy Pelosi &amp; the Democrat House are getting nothing done. Perhaps they could lead the way with the USMCA the spectacular &amp; very popular new Trade Deal that replaces NAFTA the worst Trade Deal in the history of the U.S.A. Great for our Farmers Manufacturers &amp; Unions!

Tweet: Everyone very excited about the new deal with Mexico!

Tweet: I would like to thank the President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and his foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard together with all of the many representatives of both the United States and Mexico for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed!

Tweet: Watched MSNBC this morning just to see what the opposition was saying about events of the past week. Such lies almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth. Fake News! No wonder their ratings along with CNN are WAY DOWN. The hatred Comcast has is amazing!

Tweet: Just watched the Great @RickBarry44 Backetball Hall of Famer on the @marklevinshow @FoxNews. A wonderful interview of a very smart and interesting guy by the man Mark Levin who has the number one bestselling book Unfreedom of the Press. Two Winners!

Tweet: I know it is not at all “Presidential” to hit back at the Corrupt Media or people who work for the Corrupt Media when they make false statements about me or the Trump Administration. Problem is if you don’t hit back people believe the Fake News is true. So we’ll hit back!

Tweet: Twitter should let the banned Conservative Voices back onto their platform without restriction. It’s called Freedom of Speech remember. You are making a Giant Mistake!

Tweet: If President Obama made the deals that I have made both at the Border and for the Economy the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible &amp; a National Holiday would be immediately declared. With me despite our record setting Economy and all that I have done no credit!

Tweet: The Failing @nytimes story on Mexico and Illegal Immigration through our Southern Border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue bad reporting and the paper is embarrassed by it. The only problem is that they knew it was Fake News before it went out. Corrupt Media!

Tweet: Now with our new deal Mexico is doing more for the USA on Illegal Immigration than the Democrats. In fact the Democrats are doing NOTHING they want Open Borderswhich means Illigal Immigration Drugs and Crime.

Tweet: When will the Failing New York Times admit that their front page story on the the new Mexico deal at the Border is a FRAUD and nothing more than a badly reported “hit job” on me something that has been going on since the first day I announced for the presidency! Sick Journalism

Tweet: Thank you @MarkLevinShow and John Eastman!

Tweet: Can’t believe they are bringing in John Dean the disgraced Nixon White House Counsel who is a paid CNN contributor. No Collusion - No Obstruction! Democrats just want a do-over which they’ll never get!

Tweet: New book just out “The Real Deal My Decade Fighting Battles and Winning Wars With Trump” is really wonderful. It is written by two people who are very smart &amp; know me well George Sorial &amp; Damian Bates as opposed to all the books where the author has no clue who I am. ENJOY!

Tweet: “Jerry Nadler’s Trump Bashing Show Is A Bust.” Headline New York Post. @foxandfriends The Greatest Witch Hunt of all time continues. All crimes were by the other side but the Committee refuses to even take a look. Deleting 33000 Emails is the real Obstruction - and much more!

Tweet: PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!

Tweet: Sad when you think about it but Mexico right now is doing more for the United States at the Border than the Democrats in Congress! @foxandfriends

Tweet: This is because the Euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar putting the U.S. at a big disadvantage. The Fed Interest rate way to high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening! They don’t have a clue!

Tweet: On my way to Iowa - just heard nearly 1000 agriculture groups signed a letter urging Congress to approve the USMCA. Our Patriot Farmers &amp; rural America have spoken! Now Congress must do its job &amp; support these great men and women by passing the bipartisan USMCA Trade Agreement!

Tweet: Thank you @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell for understanding the Democrats game of not playing it straight on the ridiclious Witch Hunt Hoax in the Senate. Cryin’ Chuck will never stop. Did Senator @MarkWarner ever report speaking to a Russian!?

Tweet: Almost 70% in new Poll say don’t impeach. So ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side. They can’t win the election fairly!

Tweet: Thousands of people are already lined up in Orlando some two days before tomorrow nights big Rally. Large Screens and food trucks will be there for those that can’t get into the 25000 capacity arena. It will be a very exciting evening! Make America Great Again!

Tweet: The story in the @nytimes about the U.S. escalating attacks on Russia’s power grid is Fake News and the Failing New York Times knows it. They should immediately release their sources which if they exist at all which I doubt are phony. Times must be held fully accountable!

Tweet: Wow! The State Department said it has identified 30 Security Incidents involving current or former employees and their handling of Crooked Hillary Clinton’s Emails. @FoxNews This is really big. Never admitted before. Highly Classified Material. Will the Dems investigate this?

Tweet: Only a few people showed up for the so-called Impeachment rallies over the weekend. The numbers were anemic no spirit no hope. More importantly No Collusion No Obstruction!

Tweet: Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the Euro against the Dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA. They have been getting away with this for years along with China and others.

Tweet: European Markets rose on comments (unfair to U.S.) made today by Mario D!

Tweet: The Fake News doesn’t report it but Republican enthusiasm is at an all time high. Look what is going on in Orlando Florida right now! People have never seen anything like it (unless you play a guitar). Going to be wild - See you later!

Tweet: At the request of Democrats I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border. If not Deportations start!

Tweet: I never called the strike against Iran “BACK” as people are incorrectly reporting I just stopped it from going forward at this time!

Tweet: I want to give the Democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to Asylum and Loopholes. This will fix the Southern Border together with the help that Mexico is now giving us. Probably won’t happen but worth a try. Two weeks and big Deportation begins!

Tweet: Wonderful Church service at Camp David. Thank you!

Tweet: When our Country had no debt and built everything from Highways to the Military with CASH we had a big system of Tariffs. Now we allow other countries to steal our wealth treasure and jobs - But no more! The USA is doing great with unlimited upside into the future!

Tweet: Wow @FoxNews did great in the ratings. CNN is dead as a door nail(no credibility) and MSNBC is dying fast. @foxandfriends and @MariaBartiromo are doing great!

Tweet: Too bad the Dems in Congress won’t do anything at all about Border Security. They want Open Borders which means crime. But we are getting it done including building the Wall! More people than ever before are coming because the USA Economy is so good the best in history.

Tweet: I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo today at 8:15 A.M. on @FoxBusiness. Enjoy!

Tweet: Democrats want Open Borders which equals violent crime drugs and human trafficking. They also want very high taxes like 90%. Republicans want what’s good for America - the exact opposite!

Tweet: It was my great honor to speak at the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition Conference today in Washington D.C. Thank you! #RTM2019

Tweet: The Democrats should change the Loopholes and Asylum Laws so lives will be saved at our Southern Border. They said it was not a crisis at the Border that it was all just “manufactured.” Now they admit that I was right - But they must do something about it. Fix the Laws NOW!

Tweet: Just departed for the #G20 Summit in Osaka Japan!🇺🇸🇯🇵

Tweet: The Democrats would save many lives if they would change our broken and very DANGEROUS Immigration Laws. It can be done instantly!

Tweet: Just stopped in Alaska and said hello to our GREAT troops!

Tweet: I look forward to speaking with Prime Minister Modi about the fact that India for years having put very high Tariffs against the United States just recently increased the Tariffs even further. This is unacceptable and the Tariffs must be withdrawn!

Tweet: Thank you @MSNBC real professionals! @chucktodd @maddow

Tweet: Thank you! #G20Summit

Tweet: The Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election all the way up to the day that I took office because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President. That big Stock Market increase must be credited to me. If Hillary won - a Big Crash!

Tweet: I am in Japan at the G-20 representing our Country well but I heard it was not a good day for Sleepy Joe or Crazy Bernie. One is exhausted the other is nuts - so what’s the big deal?

Tweet: After some very important meetings including my meeting with President Xi of China I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)!

Tweet: Thank you #G20OsakaSummit

Tweet: I am in South Korea now. President Moon and I have “toasted” our new Trade Deal a far better one for us than that which it replaced. Today I will visit with and speak to our Troops - and also go the the DMZ (long planned). My meeting with President Moon went very well!

Tweet: The highly respected Farm Journal has just announced my Approval Rating with our great Farmers at 74% and that despite all of the Fake &amp; Corrupt News that they are forced to endure. Farmers have been unfairly treated for many years - and that is turning around FAST!

Tweet: The leaders of virtually every country that I met at the G-20 congratulated me on our great economy. Many countries are having difficulties on that score. We have the best economy anywhere in the world with GREAT &amp; UNLIMITED potential looking into the future!

Tweet: Leaving South Korea after a wonderful meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Un. Stood on the soil of North Korea an important statement for all and a great honor!

Tweet: So many amazing things happened over the last three days. All or at least most of those things are great for the United States. Much was accomplished!

Tweet: “Stock had the Best First Half since 1997.” @WallStreetJour Our Country is doing great - the talk of the world!

Tweet: “Stocks Cap Best First Half Since 1997” @WallStreetJour Our Country is doing great!

Tweet: “Stocks Cap Best First Half Since 1997” @WSJ Our Country is doing great!

Tweet: Congratulations to legislators in New Jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state. Many were planning to leave &amp; will now be staying. New York &amp; others should start changing their thought process on taxes fast!

Tweet: Thank you to President Moon of South Korea for hosting the American Delegation and me immediately following the very successful G-20 in Japan. While there it was great to call on Chairman Kim of North Korea to have our very well covered meeting. Good things can happen for all!

Tweet: Congratulations to Prime Minister Abe of Japan for hosting such a fantastic and well run G-20. There wasn’t a thing that was missing or a mistake that was made. PERFECT! The people of Japan must be very proud of their Prime Minister.

Tweet: That’s right The Trump Foundation gave away 100% plus with Zero rent or expenses charged and has been being sued by Cuomo and New York State for years - another part of the political Witch Hunt. Just in case anyone is interested - Clinton Foundation never even looked at!

Tweet: I am excited to announce that @MercedesSchlapp will soon be joining our Campaign. She feels so strongly about our Country &amp; its future. We are setting records in so many ways &amp; we will keep it going. Mercedes has done a fantastic job within the Administration &amp; I am so thankful!

Tweet: I will be interviewed by @TuckerCarlson tonight at 8:00pm on @FoxNews!

Tweet: Mark Levin has written a big number one bestselling book called conspicuously and accurately “Unfreedom of the Press.” It is a great book that tells it like it is fake news and all. Keep this book number one!

Tweet: As most people are aware according to the Polls I won EVERY debate including the three with Crooked Hillary Clinton despite the fact that in the first debate they modulated the sound on me and got caught. This crew looks somewhat easier than Crooked but you never know?

Tweet: The Economy is the BEST IT HAS EVER BEEN! Even much of the Fake News is giving me credit for that!

Tweet: Big 4th of July in D.C. “Salute to America.” The Pentagon &amp; our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this &amp; showing to the American people among other things the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World. Incredible Flyovers &amp; biggest ever Fireworks!

Tweet: Robert Mueller is being asked to testify yet again. He said he could only stick to the Report &amp; that is what he would and must do. After so much testimony &amp; total transparency this Witch Hunt must now end. No more Do Overs. No Collusion No Obstruction. The Great Hoax is dead!

Tweet: Thanks to “Phantom Fireworks” and “Fireworks by Grucci" for their generosity in donating the biggest fireworks show Washington D.C. has ever seen. CEO's Bruce Zoldan and Phil Grucci are helping to make this the greatest 4th of July celebration in our Nations history!

Tweet: I am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate Judy Shelton Ph. D. U.S. Executive Dir European Bank of Reconstruction &amp; Development. Judy is a Founding Member of the board of directors of Empower America and has served on the board of directors of Hilton Hotels.

Tweet: Thanks @RobertJeffress!

Tweet: Iran was violating the 150 Billion Dollar (plus 1.8 Billion Dollar in CASH) Nuclear Deal with the United States and others who paid NOTHING long before I became President - and they have now breached their stockpile limit. Not good!

Tweet: Our July 4th Salute to America at the Lincoln Memorial is looking to be really big. It will be the show of a lifetime!

Tweet: We have the greatest economy anywhere in the world. We have the greatest military anywhere in the world. Not bad!

Tweet: S&amp;P 500 hits new record high. Up 19% for the year. Congratulations!

Tweet: China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games - as they have for many years!

Tweet: The cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth. We own the planes we have the pilots the airport is right next door (Andrews) all we need is the fuel. We own the tanks and all. Fireworks are donated by two of the greats. Nice!

Tweet: Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher his wonderful wife Andrea and his entire family. You have been through much together. Glad I could help!

Tweet: The News Reports about the Department of Commerce dropping its quest to put the Citizenship Question on the Census is incorrect or to state it differently FAKE! We are absolutely moving forward as we must because of the importance of the answer to this question.

Tweet: If Illegal Immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers just tell them not to come. All problems solved!

Tweet: Mexico is doing a far better job than the Democrats on the Border. Thank you Mexico!

Tweet: Iran has just issued a New Warning. Rouhani says that they will Enrich Uranium to “any amount we want” if there is no new Nuclear Deal. Be careful with the threats Iran. They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!

Tweet: Today’s Stock Market is the highest in the history of our great Country! This is the 104th time since the Election of 2016 that we have reached a NEW HIGH. Congratulations USA!

Tweet: So important for our Country that the very simple and basic “Are you a Citizen of the United States?” question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census. Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this even on the 4th of July!

Tweet: HAPPY 4TH OF JULY!

Tweet: Great news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest &amp; most disloyal men in Congress is “quitting” the Party. No Collusion No Obstruction! Knew he couldn’t get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat. A total loser!

Tweet: Looks like a lot of people already heading to SALUTE TO AMERICA at Lincoln Memorial. It will be well worth the trip and wait. See you there at 6:00 P.M. Amazing music and bands. Thank you ARMY!

Tweet: Been fully briefed on earthquake in Southern California. All seems to be very much under control!

Tweet: Our Country is the envy of the World. Thank you Mr. President!

Tweet: Democrats must change the Loophole &amp; Asylum Laws - but they probably won’t! They want Open Borders which means massive crime and drugs!

Tweet: Jerry will be getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom well deserved!

Tweet: Great Coach Great Guy!

Tweet: A wonderful man and great Republican!

Tweet: Joe Biden is a reclamation project. Some things are just not salvageable. China and other countries that ripped us off for years are begging for him. He deserted our military our law enforcement and our healthcare. Added more debt than all other Presidents combined. Won’t win!

Tweet: Sleepy Joe Biden just admitted he worked with segregationists and separately has already been very plain about the fact that he will be substantially raising everyone’s taxes if he becomes president. Ridiculously all Democrats want to substantially raise taxes!

Tweet: Last year was the first in 51 years where prescription drug prices actually went down but things have been and are being put in place that will drive them down substantially. If Dems would work with us in a bipartisan fashion we would get big results very fast!

Tweet: Congratulations to the U.S. Women’s Soccer Team on winning the World Cup! Great and exciting play. America is proud of you all!

Tweet: We are building the Wall now but the reason the badly needed Wall wasn’t approved in the Republican controlled House and Senate was that we had a very slim majority in the Senate &amp; needed 9 Democrat votes. They were totally unwilling to give Wall votes to us want Open Borders!

Tweet: Cute!

Tweet: A massive crowd that Fake News &amp; some Dems didn’t want to Report!

Tweet: Thank you Ari!

Tweet: Brilliant Constitutional Lawyer Dr. John Eastman said the Special Prosecutor (Mueller) should have NEVER been appointed in the first place. The entire exercise was fundamentally illegal. The Witch Hunt should never happen to another President of the U.S. again. A TOTAL SCAM!

Tweet: Spoke to @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy about the earthquakes in California and informed him that we will be working very closely on emergency funding. Also spoke to Governor @GavinNewsom - all working together!

Tweet: Very good numbers on the economy. Much potential for growth. Trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation. We have been treated very unfairly (to put it mildly) by other countries for many years but that is changing!

Tweet: “I agree with the President the Supreme Court got it wrong. There should be a question about Citizenship on the Census. A.G. Barr sees a pathway to add the Citizenship Question.” Steve Doocy @foxandfriends Working hard on something that should be so easy. People are fed up!

Tweet: Outrage is growing in the Great State of Minnesota where our Patriots are now having to fight for the right to say the Pledge of Allegiance. I will be fighting with you! @foxandfriends

Tweet: Food Stamp participation hits 10 year low. Wow! @OANN

Tweet: India has long had a field day putting Tariffs on American products. No longer acceptable!

Tweet: After a wonderful dinner at the @USTreasury last night with the Amir of Qatar @TamimBinHamad it was my great honor to welcome him to the @WhiteHouse this afternoon!

Tweet: More and more the Radical Left is using Commerce to hurt their “Enemy.” They put out the name of a store brand or company and ask their so-called followers not to do business there. They don’t care who gets hurt but also don’t understand that two can play that game!

Tweet: So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case (Are you a Citizen of the United States?) won’t let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use. Could this be a first?

Tweet: “The reality is that this was a plot from the very beginning to frame Trump....” @RudyGiuliani

Tweet: “FBI’s Christopher Steele (FAKE) Story Falls Apart: False Intel &amp; Media Contacts Were Flagged Before FISA.” John Solomon The Hill. @seanhannity

Tweet: The Dems Witch Hunt continues!

Tweet: Iran has long been secretly “enriching” in total violation of the terrible 150 Billion Dollar deal made by John Kerry and the Obama Administration. Remember that deal was to expire in a short number of years. Sanctions will soon be increased substantially!

Tweet: My Administration is taking groundbreaking action to bring new hope to millions of Americans suffering from kidney disease. Today I signed an Executive Order Advancing American Kidney

Tweet: Thank you Robert Johnson!

Tweet: Today on this “USMCA Day of Action” thousands of grassroots supporters are urging Congress to pass the great bipartisan USMCA. USMCA = more JOBS for American workers more economic growth and more OPPORTUNITY for our farmers ranchers and businesses. #USMCAnow

Tweet: The White House will be hosting a very big and very important Social Media Summit today. Would I have become President without Social Media? Yes (probably)! At its conclusion we will all go to the beautiful Rose Garden for a News Conference on the Census and Citizenship.

Tweet: The Pledge of Allegiance to our great Country in St. Louis Park Minnesota is under siege. That is why I am going to win the Great State of Minnesota in the 2020 Election. People are sick and tired of this stupidity and disloyalty to our wonderful USA!

Tweet: The Fake News Media loves the narrative that I didn’t use many banks because the banks didn’t like me. No I didn’t use many banks because I didn’t (don’t) need their money (old fashioned isn’t it?). If I did it would have been very easy for me to get.

Tweet: Democrats had to quickly take down a tweet called “Kids In Cages Inhumane Treatment at the Border” because the horrible picture used was from the Obama years. Very embarrassing! @foxandfriends

Tweet: Will be a big and exciting day at the White House for Social Media!

Tweet: Mexico is doing great at the Border but China is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great Farmers that they said they would. Hopefully they will start soon!

Tweet: “It seems that the Brits and the French and the Germans are coming around to the idea that the Iranians are up to no good!” @BillHemmer @FoxNews

Tweet: Dow just hit 27000 for first time EVER!

Tweet: So happy that I was able to keep Sikorsky Helicopter in the Great State of Pennsylvania. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: To everyone on the Gulf Coast: As you make preparations to protect your homes &amp; loved ones from flooding &amp; the coming storm it is imperative that you heed the directions of @FEMA State &amp; Local Officials. We are working closely w/ them. Please be prepared be careful &amp; be SAFE!

Tweet: Wow @CNN RATINGS HAVE CRASHED. LOST ALL CREDIBILITY!

Tweet: We have a GREAT TEAM in Pennsylvania! I’m proud to say that our good friends Lawrence Tabas &amp; Bernadette “Bernie” Comfort will now be working together to run the @PAGOP. Lawrence will be Chairman &amp; Bernie will Chair my Pennsylvania Campaign. We must have &amp; do great UNITY in PA!

Tweet: BOOMERANG OF JUSTICE @SeanHannity

Tweet: EXPOSING THE REAL 2016 ELECTION SCANDAL!

Tweet: “MUELLER’S PARTISAN WITCH HUNT!”

Tweet: Andy McCabe is a major sleazebag. Among many other things he took massive amounts of money from Crooked Hillary reps for wife’s campaign while Hillary was under “investigation” by FBI!

Tweet: This is one of the most horrible abuses of all. Those texts between gaga lovers would have told the whole story. Illegal deletion by Mueller. They gave us “the insurance policy.”

Tweet: 94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party an all time high. Ronald Reagan was 87%. Thank you!

Tweet: A big risk of major flooding in large parts of Louisiana and all across the Gulf Coast. Please be very careful!

Tweet: Thank you so nice but we are getting it done anyway!

Tweet: Think what it would be without the 3 year Witch Hunt and Fake News Media in partnership with the Democrats!

Tweet: We are doing great Economically as a Country Number One despite the Fed’s antiquated policy on rates and tightening. Much room to grow!

Tweet: When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President for the foul language they have used and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them &amp; their horrible &amp; disgusting actions!

Tweet: If Democrats want to unite around the foul language &amp; racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular &amp; unrepresentative Congresswomen it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the U.S.

Tweet: Here we go with the Fake Polls. Just like what happened with the Election against Crooked Hillary Clinton. ABC NBC CNN @nytimes @washingtonpost they all got it wrong on purpose. Suppression Polls so early? They will never learn!

Tweet: The Dems were trying to distance themselves from the four “progressives” but now they are forced to embrace them. That means they are endorsing Socialism hate of Israel and the USA! Not good for the Democrats!

Tweet: The Obama Administration built the Cages not the Trump Administration! DEMOCRATS MUST GIVE US THE VOTES TO CHANGE BAD IMMIGRATION LAWS.

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: “The best economy in our lifetime!” @IngrahamAngle

Tweet: Looking forward to tomorrow night’s rally in Greenville North Carolina at 7:00 P.M. Eastern!

Tweet: The Democrats in Congress are getting nothing done not on drug pricing not on immigration not on infrastructure not on nothing! Sooo much opportunity yet all they want to do is go “fishing.” The American people are tired of the never ending Witch Hunt they want results now!

Tweet: Big Rally tonight in Greenville North Carolina. Lots of great things to tell you about including the fact that our Economy is the best it has ever been. Best Employment &amp; Stock Market Numbers EVER. I’ll talk also about people who love and hate our Country (mostly love)! 7:PM

Tweet: After a ten year search the so-called “mastermind” of the Mumbai Terror attacks has been arrested in Pakistan. Great pressure has been exerted over the last two years to find him!

Tweet: New Poll: The Rasmussen Poll one of the most accurate in predicting the 2016 Election has just announced that “Trump” numbers have recently gone up by four points to 50%. Thank you to the vicious young Socialist Congresswomen. America will never buy your act! #MAGA2020

Tweet: GOD BLESS THE USA🇺🇸

Tweet: See you tonight North Carolina! #MAGA2020

Tweet: THANK YOU Greenville North Carolina! #MAGA2020

Tweet: Today on behalf of the American people I received an American flag that flew aboard a ship carrying the first waves of U.S. Service Members to land in

Tweet: This should have been taken care of years ago the Trump Administration is taking care of these thugs

Tweet: Today @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome members of Team USA to the @WhiteHouse for a great celebration of their success during the 2019 @SpecialOlympics @WorldGamesAD! Congratulations @specialolyUSA! #Cheer4USA

Tweet: Great new book “Justice On Trial The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.” Fantastic job by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino!

Tweet: Because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the Federal Reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically. In other words our interest costs are much higher than other countries when they should be lower. Correct!

Tweet: Thank you! #MAGA2020

Tweet: Just spoke to @KanyeWest about his friend A$AP Rocky’s incarceration. I will be calling the very talented Prime Minister of Sweden to see what we can do about helping A$AP Rocky. So many people would like to see this quickly resolved!

Tweet: With the incompetent Mayor of London you will never have safe streets!

Tweet: As you can see I did nothing to lead people on nor was I particularly happy with their chant. Just a very big and patriotic crowd. They love the USA!

Tweet: Thank you Bill. Very nice!

Tweet: You can add 10% or 15% to this number. Economy doing better than EVER before!

Tweet: Economic numbers reach an all time high the best in our Country’s history. Great to be a part of something so good for so many!

Tweet: I will help Angel Mom (and great woman) Mary Ann Mendoza with Twitter. I know Mary Ann from the beginning and she should never be silenced. She is a winner who has lost so much her child. Twitter if you’re watching please do what you have to do NOW! @foxandfriends

Tweet: The Great State of West Virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well. When I became President it was practically shut down and closed for business. Not anymore!

Tweet: Big progress at the Border but Dems in Congress must change the Immigration Laws for all to be good! End the Loopholes and much more.

Tweet: The Washington Post Story about my speech in North Carolina and tweet with its phony sources who do not exist is Fake News. The only thing people were talking about is the record setting crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm far greater than the Democrats. You’ll see in 2020!

Tweet: Presidential Harassment!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: I don’t believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country. They should apologize to America (and Israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said. They are destroying the Democrat Party but are weak &amp; insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation!

Tweet: Thank you very much for revealing the incredible facts which the Fake News Media will never do! @SteveHiltonx @NextRevFNC

Tweet: It is far more costly for the Federal Reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down! Very inexpensive in fact productive to move now. The Fed raised &amp; tightened far too much &amp; too fast. In other words they missed it (Big!). Don’t miss it again!

Tweet: The Mainstream Media is out of control. They constantly lie and cheat in order to get their Radical Left Democrat views out their for all to see. It has never been this bad. They have gone bonkers &amp; no longer care what is right or wrong. This large scale false reporting is sick!

Tweet: Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People!

Tweet: The Report of Iran capturing CIA spies is totally false. Zero truth. Just more lies and propaganda (like their shot down drone) put out by a Religious Regime that is Badly Failing and has no idea what to do. Their Economy is dead and will get much worse. Iran is a total mess!

Tweet: Going with First Lady to pay our respects to Justice Stevens. Leaving now!

Tweet: The “Squad” is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young inexperienced and not very smart. They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left and were against humanitarian aid at the Border...And are now against ICE and Homeland Security. So bad for our Country!

Tweet: When we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated Barrier on the Southern Border something which cannot do the job the Fake News Media gives us zero credit for building a new Wall. We have replaced many miles of old Barrier with powerful new Walls!

Tweet: “I completely read the entire Mueller Report and do you know what I concluded after reading both Volume 1 and Volume 2? There is no there there. NO THERE THERE! We completely wasted everybody’s time and taxpayer’s money.” @trishregan

Tweet: Congratulations to Boris Johnson on becoming the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He will be great!

Tweet: KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: Farmers are starting to do great again after 15 years of a downward spiral. The 16 Billion Dollar China “replacement” money didn’t exactly hurt!

Tweet: In 2016 I almost won Minnesota. In 2020 because of America hating anti-Semite Rep. Omar &amp; the fact that Minnesota is having its best economic year ever I will win the State! “We are going to be a nightmare to the President” she say. No AOC Plus 3 are a Nightmare for America!

Tweet: When an old Wall at the Southern Border that is crumbling and falling over built in an important section to keep out problems is replaced with a brand new 30 foot high steel and concrete Wall the Media says no new Wall has been built. Fake News! Building lots of Wall!

Tweet: Leaving for Turning Point USA. Will be speaking to some of the greatest and smartest young people on the planet. See you there!

Tweet: Budget Deal gives great victories to our Military and Vets keeps out Democrat poison pill riders. Republicans and Democrats in Congress need to act ASAP and support this deal.

Tweet: Just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a Never Trumper attorney to help Robert Mueller with his testimony before Congress tomorrow. What a disgrace to our system. Never heard of this before. VERY UNFAIR SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. A rigged Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Just watched Rep. Eric Swalwell be asked endless softball questions by @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews about the phony Witch Hunt. He was just forced out of the Democrat Presidential Primary because he polled at ZERO. Fox sure ain’t what it used to be. Too bad!

Tweet: THANK YOU @TPUSA! #MAGA

Tweet: Oh well we still have the great @seanhannity who I hear has a really strong show tonight. 9:00 P.M.

Tweet: Congratulations to our new Secretary of Defense Mark @EsperDoD!

Tweet: The young leaders here today (@TPUSA) are part of a movement unlike anything in the history of our nation. It is a movement about reclaiming YOUR future rebuilding YOUR Country restoring YOUR destiny and renewing the values that are the true source of American GREATNESS!

Tweet: So Robert Mueller has now asked for his long time Never Trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers. What’s this all about? His lawyer represented the “basement server guy” who got off free in the Crooked Hillary case. This should NOT be allowed. Rigged Witch Hunt!

Tweet: So Democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime try pinning it on a very innocent President and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our Country they call It Obstruction? Wrong! Why didn’t Robert Mueller investigate the investigators?

Tweet: It was NEVER agreed that Robert Mueller could use one of his many Democrat Never Trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers. This was specifically NOT agreed to and I would NEVER have agreed to it. The Greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history by far!

Tweet: Why didn’t Robert Mueller &amp; his band of 18 Angry Democrats spend any time investigating Crooked Hillary Clinton Lyin’ &amp; Leakin’ James Comey Lisa Page and her Psycho lover Peter S Andy McCabe the beautiful Ohr family Fusion GPS and many more including HIMSELF &amp; Andrew W?

Tweet: So why didn’t the highly conflicted Robert Mueller investigate how and why Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted and acid washed 33000 Emails immediately AFTER getting a SUBPOENA from the United States Congress? She must have GREAT lawyers!

Tweet: NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION!

Tweet: KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: “This has been a disaster for the Democrats and a disaster for the reputation of Robert Mueller.” Chris Wallace @FoxNews

Tweet: “Mueller was asked whether or not the investigation was impeded in any way and he said no.” In other words there was NO OBSTRUCTION. @KatiePavlich @FoxNews

Tweet: I would like to thank the Democrats for holding this morning’s hearing. Now after 3 hours Robert Mueller has to subject himself to #ShiftySchiff - an Embarrassment to our Country!

Tweet: TRUTH IS A FORCE OF NATURE!

Tweet: “The kind of questions the White House Correspondents were asking is almost like they didn’t see what went on at the hearings!” @JesseBWatters The hearings were a disaster for Robert Mueller &amp; the Democrats. Nevertheless the Fake News Media will try to make the best out of it!

Tweet: Even Michael Moore agrees that the Dems and Mueller blew it!

Tweet: Very disappointed in Prime Minister Stefan Löfven for being unable to act. Sweden has let our African American Community down in the United States. I watched the tapes of A$AP Rocky and he was being followed and harassed by troublemakers. Treat Americans fairly! #FreeRocky

Tweet: Give A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM. We do so much for Sweden but it doesn’t seem to work the other way around. Sweden should focus on its real crime problem! #FreeRocky

Tweet: I am pleased to announce the House has passed our budget deal 284-149. Great for our Military and our Vets. A big thank you!

Tweet: “Intelligence Community disappointed Mueller didn’t investigate the Steele Dossier.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews ...And plenty of other things!

Tweet: “Taken for Granted” a wonderful new book by Gianni Caldwell on how Conservatism can win back the Americans that Liberalism Failed. Full Endorsement!

Tweet: “Taken for Granted” a wonderful new book by Gianno Caldwell on how Conservatism can win back the Americans that Liberalism failed has my full Endorsement!

Tweet: There may or may not be National Security concerns with regard to Google and their relationship with China. If there is a problem we will find out about it. I sincerely hope there is not!!!

Tweet: Apple will not be given Tariff wavers or relief for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA no Tariffs!

Tweet: Q2 GDP Up 2.1% Not bad considering we have the very heavy weight of the Federal Reserve anchor wrapped around our neck. Almost no inflation. USA is set to Zoom!

Tweet: Apple will not be given Tariff waiver or relief for Mac Pro parts that are made in China. Make them in the USA no Tariffs!

Tweet: France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them it should be their home Country the USA. We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron’s foolishness shortly. I’ve always said American wine is better than French wine!

Tweet: Great morning at the Pentagon yesterday. Congratulations to our new Defense Secretary Mark @EsperDoD!

Tweet: The WTO is BROKEN when the world’s RICHEST countries claim to be developing countries to avoid WTO rules and get special treatment. NO more!!! Today I directed the U.S. Trade Representative to take action so that countries stop CHEATING the system at the expense of the USA!

Tweet: “@DHSgov @DHSMcAleenan Puts Guatemalan Migrants on Fast Track Home”

Tweet: Wow! Big VICTORY on the Wall. The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction allows Southern Border Wall to proceed. Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!

Tweet: Why is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States. No human being would want to live there. Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!

Tweet: Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 &amp; others). Would make it easier for police to do their job!

Tweet: The Democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly &amp; irrevocably tarnished Witch Hunt Hoax until Robert Mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude &amp; incompetence that the Halls of Congress have ever seen. Truth is he had no facts on his side. Nothing he could do!

Tweet: The Dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible Mueller performance and are starting to spin impeachment all over again. How sick &amp; disgusting and bad for our Country are they. What they are doing is so wrong but they do it anyway. Dems have become the do nothing Party!

Tweet: Such a big victory of our Country! “Supreme Court approves Trump Administration plan to use Military Funds for the Wall.” @FoxNews We will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure over time by other countries.

Tweet: Democrats don’t care about Border Security. They refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the Loopholes and Asylum. Would be so easy! They want Open Borders which means CRIMECRIMECRIME!

Tweet: Elijah Cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through “Oversight.” He does NOTHING for his very poor very dangerous and very badly run district! Take a look.... #BlacksForTrump2020

Tweet: We gave Nadler and his Trump hating Dems the complete Mueller Report (we didn’t have to) and even Mueller himself but now that both were a total BUST they say it wasn’t good enough. Nothing will ever be good enough for them. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION TOTAL EXONERATION. DEMOCRAT WITCH HUNT!

Tweet: .@RepCummings why don’t you focus on your district!?

Tweet: .@RepCummings — your district!

Tweet: Thanks @JudgeJeanine!

Tweet: Thank you @GOPLeader!

Tweet: Thank you @MarkLevinShow!

Tweet: So sad that Elijah Cummings has been able to do so little for the people of Baltimore. Statistically Baltimore ranks last in almost every major category. Cummings has done nothing but milk Baltimore dry but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing!

Tweet: The real Collusion the Conspiracy the Crime was between the Clinton Campaign the DNC Fusion GPS Christopher Steele.....(and many others including Comey McCabe Lisa Page and her lover Ohr and his wonderful wife and on and on!). @replouiegohmert

Tweet: The Democrats are still doing the Russians dirty work as they continue to push the fake crime. Media credibility is now shot Democrat credibility is shot they’ve wasted over 100 hearings on a Hoax they’ve done nothing on Infrastructure drug prices trade....@JesseBWatters

Tweet: “If it weren’t for Donald Trump we would never know how corrupt these Democrats are we would never know for sure that there was a Deep State. Now we know it.” @JudgeJeanine

Tweet: Speaking of failing badly has anyone seen what is happening to Nancy Pelosi’s district in San Francisco. It is not even recognizeable lately. Something must be done before it is too late. The Dems should stop wasting time on the Witch Hunt Hoax and start focusing on our Country!

Tweet: “Elijah Cummings has had his chance to address it (crime &amp; conditions in Baltimore) for decades and he hasn’t gotten it done.” @PeteHegseth @foxandfriends How can he get it done when he just wants to use his Oversight Committee to hurt innocent people and divide our Country!

Tweet: There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!

Tweet: If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and Baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. His radical “oversight” is a joke!

Tweet: Under the Trump Administration African American unemployment is the lowest (best) in the history of the United States. No President has come close to doing this before! I also created successful Opportunity Zones. Waiting for Nancy and Elijah to say “Thank you Mr. President!”

Tweet: “If the Democrats would have closed the Loopholes two years ago when President Trump asked them to do so none of this stuff would have happened.” @ThomasHomanICE

Tweet: “The Democrats hate this President so much they’re forgetting about their duty to secure our Border.” @ThomasHomanICE @SteveHiltonx Sad but true!

Tweet: Law Enforcement is at the scene of shootings in Gilroy California. Reports are that shooter has not yet been apprehended. Be careful and safe!

Tweet: Good luck with the book George should do well!

Tweet: I have known Al for 25 years. Went to fights with him &amp; Don King always got along well. He “loved Trump!” He would ask me for favors often. Al is a con man a troublemaker always looking for a score. Just doing his thing. Must have intimidated Comcast/NBC. Hates Whites &amp; Cops!

Tweet: Baltimore under the leadership of Elijah Cummings has the worst Crime Statistics in the Nation. 25 years of all talk no action! So tired of listening to the same old Bull...Next Reverend Al will show up to complain &amp; protest. Nothing will get done for the people in need. Sad!

Tweet: If the Democrats are going to defend the Radical Left “Squad” and King Elijah’s Baltimore Fail it will be a long road to 2020. The good news for the Dems is that they have the Fake News Media in their pocket!

Tweet: Al Sharpton would always ask me to go to his events. He would say “it’s a personal favor to me.” Seldom but sometimes I would go. It was fine. He came to my office in T.T. during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me. Just a conman at work!

Tweet: The E.U. and China will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product. In the meantime and with very low inflation our Fed does nothing - and probably will do very little by comparison. Too bad!

Tweet: Looking forward to my meeting at 2:00 P.M. with wonderful Inner City Pastors!

Tweet: It is the 25th Anniversary of a GREAT Organization run by people who truly love our Country @JudicialWatch. On behalf of all Americans I thank them! @TomFitton

Tweet: Just remember the Iranians never won a war but never lost a negotiation!

Tweet: Elijah Cummings never even went to the Southern Border and then he screams at the very good people who despite Congresses failure to fix the Loopholes and Asylum make it work (crossings are way down and the Wall is being built). Even with zero Dem help Border getting strong!

Tweet: Baltimore’s numbers are the worst in the United States on Crime and the Economy. Billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail. The money was stolen or wasted. Ask Elijah Cummings where it went. He should investigate himself with his Oversight Committee!

Tweet: “I don’t know what it’s going to take. A lot of Democratic run cities all over America look like this it’s not just Baltimore unfortunately.” Kimberly Klacik Baltimore journalist Remember Vote for Trump what the h.... do you have to lose? Best unemployment numbers!

Tweet: Somali refugees arresed in Tucson on way to Egypt. They were in touch with an agent posing as a terrorist. One of them stated “The best wake up call is Islamic State to get victory or another 9/11.” Get smart people! #MAGA #KAG @foxandfriends

Tweet: Despite the Democrats wanting very unsafe Open Borders &amp; refusing to change the Loopholes &amp; Asylum tremendous progress is being made the the Southern Border. We all waited because we assumed the Dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible Immigration Laws.They didn’t!

Tweet: Wow! Morning Joe &amp; Psycho ratings have really crashed. Very small audience. People are tired of hearing Fake News delivered with an anger that is not to be believed. Sad when the show was sane they helped get me elected. Thanks! Was on all the time. Lost all of its juice!

Tweet: Senate is working hard on America’s Transportation Infrastructure Act. Will have BIG IMPACT on our highways and roads all across our Nation. Interest strong from Republicans and Democrats. Do I hear the beautiful word BIPARTISAN? Get it done. I am with you!

Tweet: China has lost 5 million jobs and two million manufacturing jobs due to the Trump Tariffs. Trumps got China back on its heels and the United States is doing great. @AndyPuzder @MariaBartiromo

Tweet: Heading to Jamestown Virginia. Word is the Democrats will make it as uncomfortable as possible but that’s ok because today is not about them!

Tweet: Great reception in Jamestown by both REPUBLICANS &amp; DEMOCRATS. Respect for our Country’s incredible Heritage. Thank you!

Tweet: We should immediately pass Voter ID @Voteridplease to insure the safety and sanctity of our voting system. Also Paper Ballots as backup (old fashioned but true!). Thank you!

Tweet: Thank you Amy!

Tweet: Thank you Eric!

Tweet: Such a great victory in court yesterday on the Russian Hoax the greatest political scam in the history of our Country. TREASON! Hopefully the Attorney Generel of the United States and all of those working with him will find out in great detail what happened. NEVER AGAIN!!!!

Tweet: If I hadn’t won the 2016 Election we would be in a Great Recession/Depression right now. The people I saw on stage last night &amp; you can add in Sleepy Joe Harris &amp; the rest will lead us into an economic sinkhole the likes of which we have never seen before. With me only up!

Tweet: “The lesser of two Socialists is still a Socialist!” Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana

Tweet: Lowering drug prices for many Americans - including our great seniors! At my direction @HHSGov @SecAzar just released a Safe Importation Action Plan. Our Governors will be very happy too! @GovRonDeSantis @GovofCO

Tweet: “The 99% Get a Bigger Raise”

Tweet: The Radical Left Dems went after me for using the words “drug-infested” concerning Baltimore. Take a look at Elijah C.

Tweet: Thank you Bill say hello to our GREAT VETERANS!

Tweet: Very low ratings for the Democratic Debate last night — they’re desperate for Trump!

Tweet: Experts stated that the Fed should not have tightened and then waited too long to undo their mistake. James Bullard of St. Louis Fed said they waited too long to correct the mistake that they made last December. “Mistake Powell cut rate and then he started talking.” @LouDobbs

Tweet: The cages for kids were built by the Obama Administration in 2014. He had the policy of child separation. I ended it even as I realized that more families would then come to the Border! @CNN

Tweet: Congratulations to Kelly Knight Craft of #Kentucky on her confirmation as United Nations Ambassador. After having served so admirably as Ambassador to Canada &amp; having done an outstanding job no matter how difficult the task Kelly will be fantastic at the United Nations. Winner!

Tweet: China Iran &amp; other foreign countries are looking at the Democrat Candidates and “drooling” over the small prospect that they could be dealing with them in the not too distant future. They would be able to rip off our beloved USA like never before. With President Trump NO WAY!

Tweet: Budget Deal is phenomenal for our Great Military our Vets and Jobs Jobs Jobs! Two year deal gets us past the Election. Go for it Republicans there is always plenty of time to CUT!

Tweet: BIG RALLY tonight in Cincinnati Ohio. See you there! P.S. Our Country is doing GREAT!

Tweet: A string of court cases that have been run through the legal system that have hit DEAD ENDS.... @BillHemmer @AmericaNewsroom

Tweet: Thank you Cincinnati Ohio. Together we are going to KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: Beautiful evening in Cincinnati Ohio tonight — with GREAT American Patriots! #KAG2020

Tweet: I would like to thank two Great Iowa Senators @ChuckGrassley and @SenJoniErnst - for their support today on the Spending Bill. Their vote and the vote of other Republicans and Democrats helped get this done in a bipartisan fashion. Thank you all!

Tweet: THANK YOU OHIO!! #KAG2020

Tweet: Really bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad!

Tweet: A$AP Rocky released from prison and on his way home to the United States from Sweden. It was a Rocky Week get home ASAP A$AP!

Tweet: Nice to see that one of my best pupils is still a giant Trump fan. Steve joined me after I won the primaries but I loved working with him!

Tweet: A great couple!

Tweet: Great working with you John. A big win for our amazing ranchers!

Tweet: Countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate REAL trade deals not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations. They don’t want to be targeted for Tariffs by the U.S.

Tweet: Things are going along very well with China. They are paying us Tens of Billions of Dollars made possible by their monetary devaluations and pumping in massive amounts of cash to keep their system going. So far our consumer is paying nothing - and no inflation. No help from Fed!

Tweet: Terrible shootings in ElPaso Texas. Reports are very bad many killed. Working with State and Local authorities and Law Enforcement. Spoke to Governor to pledge total support of Federal Government. God be with you all!

Tweet: Fight hard tonight Colby. You are a real Champ! #MAGA

Tweet: Pastor Scott a great guy - and tough!

Tweet: 'God be with you all': Trump pledges full support for El Paso shooting victims as lawmakers also grieve via @usatoday

Tweet: The FBI local and state law enforcement are working together in El Paso and in Dayton Ohio. Information is rapidly being accumulated in Dayton. Much has already be learned in El Paso. Law enforcement was very rapid in both instances. Updates will be given throughout the day!

Tweet: God bless the people of El Paso Texas. God bless the people of Dayton Ohio.

Tweet: God bless the people of El Paso Texas. God bless the people of Dayton Ohio.

Tweet: The Media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our Country. Fake News has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years. News coverage has got to start being fair balanced and unbiased or these terrible problems will only get worse!

Tweet: China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It’s called “currency manipulation.” Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!

Tweet: China is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of Billions of Dollars they have been taking from the U.S. with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation. So one-sided it should have been stopped many years ago!

Tweet: The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims their families and the survivors. We will stand by their side FOREVER!

Tweet: Today I am also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the DEATH PENALTY - and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly decisively and without years of needless delay.

Tweet: We must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as ONE PEOPLE. Open wounds cannot heal if we are divided. We must seek real bipartisan solutions that will truly make America safer and better for all.

Tweet: Thank you @LouDobbs and Tom Homan!

Tweet: Check out what @Google is up to for the 2020 election! #KAG2020

Tweet: Thank you @PeterSchweizer!

Tweet: “Did George Bush ever condemn President Obama after Sandy Hook. President Obama had 32 mass shootings during his reign. Not many people said Obama is out of Control. Mass shootings were happening before the President even thought about running for Pres.” @kilmeade @foxandfriends

Tweet: “It’s political season and the election is around the corner. They want to continue to push that racist narrative.” @ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends And I am the least racist person. Black Hispanic and Asian Unemployment is the lowest (BEST) in the history of the United States!

Tweet: Massive amounts of money from China and other parts of the world is pouring into the United States for reasons of safety investment and interest rates! We are in a very strong position. Companies are also coming to the U.S. in big numbers. A beautiful thing to watch!

Tweet: As they have learned in the last two years our great American Farmers know that China will not be able to hurt them in that their President has stood with them and done what no other president would do - And I’ll do it again next year if necessary!

Tweet: Thank you Mr. Wonderful I like you too! @kevinolearytv @CNBC

Tweet: Thank you @JimCramer @CNBC!

Tweet: Will be going to Dayton Ohio and El Paso Texas tomorrow to meet with First Responders Law Enforcement and some of the victims of the terrible shootings.

Tweet: Beto (phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage) O’Rourke who is embarrassed by my last visit to the Great State of Texas where I trounced him and is now even more embarrassed by polling at 1% in the Democrat Primary should respect the victims &amp; law enforcement - &amp; be quiet!

Tweet: “Meanwhile the Dayton Ohio shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren and ANTIFA.” @OANN I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!

Tweet: Today we honor all of our Country’s Purple Heart recipients their loved ones and our Gold Star Families for their immeasurable sacrifice. These American Patriots represent the unyielding and unmatched strength and determination of the U.S. Armed Forces:

Tweet: Watching Sleepy Joe Biden making a speech. Sooo Boring! The LameStream Media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy. It will be over for them not to mention the fact that our Country will do poorly with him. It will be one big crash but at least China will be happy!

Tweet: Watching Fake News CNN is better than watching Shepard Smith the lowest rated show on @FoxNews. Actually whenever possible I turn to @OANN!

Tweet: We love you Dayton Ohio!

Tweet: The people I met today in Dayton are the finest anywhere!

Tweet: I don’t know who Juaquin Castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth. Juaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much. Keep fighting Juaquin!

Tweet: I don’t know who Joaquin Castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth. Joaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much. Keep fighting Joaquin!

Tweet: Leaving El Paso for the White House. What GREAT people I met there and in Dayton Ohio. The Fake News worked overtime trying to disparage me and the two trips but it just didn’t work. The love respect &amp; enthusiasm were there for all to see. They have been through so much. Sad!

Tweet: The Dems new weapon is actually their old weapon one which they never cease to use when they are down or run out of facts RACISM! They are truly disgusting! They even used it on Nancy Pelosi. I will be putting out a list of all people who have been so (ridiculously) accused!

Tweet: Incredible afternoon in El Paso Texas. We love you and are with you all the way!

Tweet: My time spent in Dayton and El Paso with some of the greatest people on earth. Thank you for a job well done!

Tweet: Rod Blagojevich the former Governor of Illinois was sentenced to 14 years in prison. He has served 7 years. Many people have asked that I study the possibility of commuting his sentence in that it was a very severe one. White House staff is continuing the review of this matter.

Tweet: Maggie Haberman of the Failing @nytimes reported that I was annoyed by the lack of cameras inside the hospitals in Dayton &amp; El Paso when in fact I was the one who stated very strongly that I didn’t want the Fake News inside &amp; told my people NOT to let them in. Fake reporting!

Tweet: Never has the press been more inaccurate unfair or corrupt! We are not fighting the Democrats they are easy we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged Lamestream Media. They have gone totally CRAZY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: China wants to make a deal so badly. Thousands of companies are leaving because of the Tariffs they must stem the flow. At the same time China may be hoping for a Democrat to win so they could continue the great ripoff of America &amp; the theft of hundreds of Billions of $’s!

Tweet: Think how wonderful it is to be able to fight back and show to so many how totally dishonest the Fake News Media really is. It may be the most corrupt and disgusting business (almost) there is! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Joe Biden just said “We believe in facts not truth.” Does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president? We are “playing” in a very big and complicated world. Joe doesn’t have a clue!

Tweet: Many incredible things are happening right now for our Country. After years of being ripped off by other nations on both Trade Deals and the Military things are changing fast. Big progress is being made. America is respected again. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: Thank you NEGOP!

Tweet: Scaramucci who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory is only upset that I didn’t want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be). Also I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!

Tweet: Two great and loyal friends!

Tweet: The United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia. We have similar though more advanced technology. The Russian “Skyfall” explosion has people worried about the air around the facility and far beyond. Not good!

Tweet: Curt Schilling a great pitcher and patriot is considering a run for Congress in Arizona. Terrific! @foxandfriends

Tweet: Thank you John you are a special guy!

Tweet: I thought Chris was Fredo also. The truth hurts. Totally lost it! Low ratings @CNN

Tweet: Through massive devaluation of their currency and pumping vast sums of money into their system the tens of billions of dollars that the U.S. is receiving is a gift from China. Prices not up no inflation. Farmers getting more than China would be spending. Fake News won’t report!

Tweet: Thank you Steve!

Tweet: Would Chris Cuomo be given a Red Flag for his recent rant? Filthy language and a total loss of control. He shouldn’t be allowed to have any weapon. He’s nuts!

Tweet: As usual China said they were going to be buying “big” from our great American Farmers. So far they have not done what they said. Maybe this will be different!

Tweet: ALL THE NEWS THAT’S NOT FIT TO PRINT! “The New York Times is no longer the paper we grew up with. It is no longer a news organization. It is now an agenda driven organization out to change the Country (for the worse!).” Michael Goodwin Highly Respected New York Post Columnist.

Tweet: Many are blaming me and the United States for the problems going on in Hong Kong. I can’t imagine why?

Tweet: Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!

Tweet: Just landed in Pennsylvania. Looking forward to making a speech on energy. So important!

Tweet: Put it back up. We are living with a Rigged &amp; Fake Media!

Tweet: So terrible!

Tweet: Just leaving. Incredible Complex. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!

Tweet: See you in New Hampshire!

Tweet: It always happens! When a Conservative does even a fraction of what Chris Cuomo did with his lunatic ranting raving &amp; cursing they get destroyed by the Fake News. But when a Liberal Democrat like Chris Cuomo does it Republicans immediately come to his defense. We never learn!

Tweet: True! Without being stuck at an airport where CNN buys (at a big price) an uninterested audience they’ve got nothing going. @CNN is BAD for America!

Tweet: Thank you Bill!

Tweet: No debate on Election Security should go forward without first agreeing that Voter ID (Identification) must play a very strong part in any final agreement. Without Voter ID it is all so meaningless!

Tweet: Great day in the incredible Commonwealth of Pennsylvania today with the amazing energy workers construction workers and craft workers who make America run – and who make America PROUD. No one in the world does it better than YOU!

Tweet: Great interview of Ron Vitiello Former Acting Ice Director by @JesseBWatters on @FoxNews about all of the work that is being (&amp; has been) done on our Southern Border. Thanks Ron terrific job! Now if only the Democrats would fix the Loopholes &amp; Asylum.

Tweet: A fighter and champion GREAT!

Tweet: Join me tomorrow night in Manchester New Hampshire at 7:00 P.M. Eastern! #KAG2020

Tweet: “The Fed has got to do something! The Fed is the Central Bank of the United States not the Central Bank of the World.” Mark Grant @Varneyco Correct! The Federal Reserve acted far too quickly and now is very very late. Too bad so much to gain on the upside!

Tweet: “So far you’ve had Tariffs imposed on 300 Billion Dollars worth of Chinese products but you can’t tell me that it has hurt our economy...&amp; it really hasn’t led to any kind of serious rise in prices at the consumer level.” @Varneyco @FoxBusiness And we are taking in $Billions!

Tweet: Tremendous amounts of money pouring into the United States. People want safety!

Tweet: The Great Charles Payne @cvpayne correctly stated that Fed Chair Jay Powell made TWO enormous mistakes. 1. When he said “mid cycle adjustment.” 2. We’re data dependent. “He did not do the right thing.” I agree (to put it mildly!). @Varneyco

Tweet: Unlike others our economy is strong!

Tweet: Sad!

Tweet: I know President Xi of China very well. He is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. He is also a good man in a “tough business.” I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem he can do it. Personal meeting?

Tweet: Two great entertainers and more importantly great people! Check out their show.

Tweet: Thank you and the Wall is under major construction!

Tweet: The Philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets. He had a long and very dangerous criminal record. Looked like he was having a good time after his capture and after wounding so many police. Long sentence - must get much tougher on street crime!

Tweet: It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit. They hate Israel &amp; all Jewish people &amp; there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. Minnesota and Michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. They are a disgrace!

Tweet: If President Xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem. I have no doubt!

Tweet: The United States is now by far the Biggest Strongest and Most Powerful Economy in the World it is not even close! As others falter we will only get stronger. Consumers are in the best shape ever plenty of cash. Business Optimism is at an All Time High!

Tweet: Our Great Farmers know how important it is to win on Trade. They will be the big winners!

Tweet: Wow! The Deputy Editor of the Failing New York Times was just demoted. Should have been Fired! Totally biased and inaccurate reporting. The paper is a Fraud Zero Credibility. Fake News takes another hit but this time a big one!

Tweet: Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party and they HATE Israel!

Tweet: The Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election. The problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on Trade and everyone knows that including China!

Tweet: Biden doesn’t have a clue! I will solve the China problem.

Tweet: Andrew thank you! We will never forgive or forget.

Tweet: Sadly much truth to this!

Tweet: “If they don’t get this Trade Deal with the U.S. done China could have it first recession (or worse!) in years. There’s disinvestment in China right now. Also the Fed is too tight (I agree).” Steve Moore Heritage Foundation

Tweet: Walmart a great indicator as to how the U.S. is doing just released outstanding numbers. Our Country unlike others is doing great! Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise.

Tweet: Thank you New Hampshire. KEEP AMERICA GREAT! #KAG2020

Tweet: Congratulations to Patrick Yoes for his election as National President of the great Fraternal Order of Police. Together we will fight for our incredible Law Enforcement Officers!

Tweet: Senator Jim Risch of the Great State of Idaho has been an incredible supporter of our Agenda! He is tough on Crime Strong on Borders and will continue to fight for our Second Amendment. Jim will never let you down. He has my Full and Complete Endorsement!

Tweet: Israel was very respectful &amp; nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib allowing her permission to visit her “grandmother.” As soon as she was granted permission she grandstanded &amp; loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately!

Tweet: Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib’s grandmother. She doesn’t have to see her now!

Tweet: Like it or not Tlaib and Omar are fast becoming the face of the Democrat Party. Cortez (AOC) is fuming not happy about this!

Tweet: I donate 100% of my President’s salary $400000 back to our Country and feel very good about it!

Tweet: Just completed a very good meeting on Afghanistan. Many on the opposite side of this 19 year war and us are looking to make a deal - if possible!

Tweet: Having dinner tonight with Tim Cook of Apple. They will be spending vast sums of money in the U.S. Great!

Tweet: Great time in New Hampshire last night. Placed was maxed out totally packed with thousands coming to the arena floor at start. Thousands more outside that were not allowed in per code. Energy was really great to see. We will win New Hampshire in 2020!

Tweet: Look at the tremendous overflow at packed arena in New Hampshire last night. Sorry we couldn’t get you in will be back soon!

Tweet: Biggest crowd EVER according to Arena people. Thousands outside trying to get in. Place was packed! Radical Left Dems &amp; their Partner LameStream Media saying Arena empty. Check out pictures. Fake News. The Enemy of the People!

Tweet: Major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an “ORGANIZATION OF TERROR.” Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!

Tweet: Thank you to @SaraCarterDC. A great and legitimate reporter as opposed to those at the Failing New York Times!

Tweet: The Fake News Media HATES to see this!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: Such a disgrace at the once great @nytimes!

Tweet: With all that this Administration has accomplished think what my Poll Numbers would be if we had an honest Media which we do not!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Doing really well!

Tweet: We are doing very well with China and talking!

Tweet: Juan Williams at @FoxNews is so pathetic and yet when he met me in the Fox Building lobby he couldn’t have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family. Yet he is always nasty and wrong!

Tweet: Our economy is the best in the world by far. Lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. Import prices down China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in. Great future for USA!

Tweet: House Democrats want to take action against Israel because it is fighting back against two (maybe four) people that have said unthinkably bad things about it &amp; the Israeli people. Dems have such disdain for Israel! What happened? AOC Plus 4 is the new face of the Democrat Party!

Tweet: Thank you @TedCruz I couldn’t agree more!

Tweet: The New York Times will be out of business soon after I leave office hopefully in 6 years. They have Zero credibility and are losing a fortune even now especially after their massive unfunded liability. I’m fairly certain they’ll endorse me just to keep it all going!

Tweet: Great cohesion inside the Republican Party the best I have ever seen. Despite all of the Fake News my Poll Numbers are great. New internal polls show them to be the strongest we’ve had so far! Think what they’d be if I got fair media coverage!

Tweet: Democrats want Open Borders and Crime! So dangerous for our Country. But we are building a big beautiful NEW Wall! I will protect America the Dems don’t know where to start!

Tweet: Wow Report Just Out! Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election! This was put out by a Clinton supporter not a Trump Supporter! Google should be sued. My victory was even bigger than thought! @JudicialWatch

Tweet: Massive overflow crowds in New Hampshire last week. Couldn’t get into packed SNHU Arena. Fake and Corrupt News would like you to believe otherwise. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: THANK YOU! #MAGA

Tweet: Spoke to my two good friends Prime Minister Modi of India and Prime Minister Khan of Pakistan regarding Trade Strategic Partnerships and most importantly for India and Pakistan to work towards reducing tensions in Kashmir. A tough situation but good conversations!

Tweet: Great discussion with Prime Minister @BorisJohnson today. We talked about Brexit and how we can move rapidly on a US-UK free trade deal. I look forward to meeting with Boris this weekend at the @G7 in France!

Tweet: Thank you to my great supporters at the 2019 @IowaStateFair!

Tweet: I promise not to do this to Greenland!

Tweet: Nobody ever heard of this dope until he met me. He only lasted 11 days!

Tweet: Thank you Jon working hard!

Tweet: Congratulations Great Show!

Tweet: The Fake and Corrupt Media is sooo bad for our Country The Enemy of the People!

Tweet: Two incredible people. I can’t believe they’re not working (few work harder)!

Tweet: Thank you Mike!

Tweet: Maria despite all of their will and energy it won’t work!

Tweet: Ratings are way down lost all credibility. Beautiful to watch!

Tweet: Just another disgruntled former employee who got fired for gross incompetence!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: The LameStream Media is far beyond Fake News they are treading in very dangerous territory!

Tweet: Sorry I don’t buy Rep. Tlaib’s tears. I have watched her violence craziness and most importantly WORDS for far too long. Now tears? She hates Israel and all Jewish people. She is an anti-Semite. She and her 3 friends are the new face of the Democrat Party. Live with it!

Tweet: CONGRATULATIONS @EricTrump and @LaraLeaTrump on the birth of Carolina Dorothy Trump. So proud!

Tweet: Brandon Judd President National Border Patrol Council. “This will effectively end Catch and Release and curb illegal entries.”

Tweet: Rep Tlaib wants to cut off aid to Israel. This is the new face the of Democrat Party? Read the AOC PLUS 3 statements on their hatred of Jews and Israel. Check out Rep. Omar (the great people of Minnesota won’t stand for this).

Tweet: “The speed bump has been missteps by the Federal Reserve.” @CharlesPayne2nd @foxandfriends So true!

Tweet: “The speed bump has been missteps by the Federal Reserve.” @cvpayne @foxandfriends So true!

Tweet: The Fake News LameStream Media is doing everything possible the “create” a U.S. recession even though the numbers &amp; facts are working totally in the opposite direction. They would be willing to hurt many people but that doesn’t matter to them. Our Economy is sooo strong sorry!

Tweet: My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000 while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!

Tweet: On my way to the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky to deliver remarks at the @AMVETSHQ 75th Annual National Convention. Look forward to being with all of my friends! #AMVETS75th

Tweet: .@NATO very unfair to the United States!

Tweet: “Tax cuts deregulation and an Administration dedicated to growing business have allowed the U.S. economy to flourish. The resulting surge in job creation and record low unemployment has put the American worker in the driver’s seat.“ @SecretaryRoss

Tweet: The Legendary Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan the Founders of Ford Motor Company and General Motors are “rolling over” at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good and cost $3000 more to consumers. Crazy!

Tweet: Great! @LouDobbs interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. @FoxNews

Tweet: It was my honor to sign a Presidential Memorandum facilitating the cancellation of student loan debt for 25K of our most severely disabled Veterans. With today’s order we express the everlasting love &amp; loyalty of a truly grateful Nation. God bless our Vets &amp; God Bless America!

Tweet: Thank you @RealWayneRoot!

Tweet: Germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields. Germany competes with the USA. Our Federal Reserve does not allow us to do what we must do. They put us at a disadvantage against our competition. Strong Dollar No Inflation! They move like quicksand. Fight or go home!

Tweet: The Economy is doing really well. The Federal Reserve can easily make it Record Setting! The question is being asked why are we paying much more in interest than Germany and certain other countries? Be early (for a change) not late. Let America win big rather than just win!

Tweet: Just heard that Sean Spicer will be on “Dancing with the Stars.” He will do great. A terrific person who loves our Country dearly!

Tweet: Check out a FANTASTIC new book “STILL WINNING – Why America Went All In On Donald Trump-And Why We Must Do It Again” by the great writer @CharlesHurt. An excellent read. Thank you!

Tweet: Looking forward to soon being in North Carolina to hold a big rally for wonderful Dan Bishop who is running for Congress. His opponent wants Open Borders Sanctuary Cities and Socialism. He likes the “Squad” more than North Carolina. Dan has my Full and Complete Endorsement!

Tweet: Congratulations to the GREAT Bob Cousy!

Tweet: .@SenCoryGardner has done a fantastic job representing the people of Colorado. He really knows how to win. Strong on Crime Borders &amp; the 2nd A Cory fights hard for our Military &amp; Vets. John Hickenlooper is badly damaged after his horrible run for President. Big Primary trouble!

Tweet: Happy birthday James!

Tweet: 94% Approval Rating within the Republican Party. Thank you!

Tweet: This despite the Fake News and Polls!

Tweet: Now the Fed can show their stuff!

Tweet: The Dow is down 573 points perhaps on the news that Representative Seth Moulton whoever that may be has dropped out of the 2020 Presidential Race!

Tweet: Just spoke with President @JairBolsonaro of Brazil. Our future Trade prospects are very exciting and our relationship is strong perhaps stronger than ever before. I told him if the United States can help with the Amazon Rainforest fires we stand ready to assist!

Tweet: Thank you to @DiamondandSilk for the really nice words and thoughts on @LouDobbs tonight hosted by Lou’s friend @DavidAsmanfox. Great job by all. P.S. Check out these two great women on tour tomorrow night in NYC at the Marriott Marquis Hotel Broadway. Have fun!

Tweet: Great! He said MAGA country did it. So terrible!

Tweet: Great going Harris!

Tweet: Highest Condolences! Thank you V.P.

Tweet: Looking forward to being with great leaders in France! Leaving soon.

Tweet: Thank you Ivanka. Really Amazing!

Tweet: Disgraceful!

Tweet: Other good polls also in fifties despite only Fake News and then phony polls by A.P. CNN NBC and as always Fox who were WAY OFF on 2016 Election!

Tweet: Such a sad and pathetic fall for @CNN and Jeff Z!

Tweet: For all of the Fake News Reporters that don’t have a clue as to what the law is relative to Presidential powers China etc. try looking at the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Case closed!

Tweet: Just had lunch with French President @EmanuelMacrone. Many good things are happening for both of our countries. Big weekend with other world leaders!

Tweet: “Face It You Probably Got A Tax Cut!” This was a New York Times headline and it is very true. If Republicans take back the House and keep the Senate and Presidency one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income Tax Cut! Democrats only want to raise your taxes!

Tweet: Just had lunch with French President @EmmanuelMacron. Many good things are happening for both of our countries. Big weekend with other world leaders!

Tweet: Looking forward to helping New York City and Governor @andrewcuomo complete the long anticipated and partially built Second Avenue Subway. Would be extended to East 125th Street in Harlem. Long in the making they now have the team that can get it done!

Tweet: North Carolina Governor Cooper Vetoed a Bill that would have required Sheriffs to cooperate with Ice. This is a terrible decision for the great people of North Carolina. He should reverse his decision and get back to the basics of fighting crime!

Tweet: France and President @EmanuelMacrone have done a really great job thus far with a very important G-7. Lunch with Emanuel was the best meeting we have yet had. Likewise evening meeting with World Leaders went very well. Progress being made!

Tweet: Our great Economy is the talk of everyone!

Tweet: France and President @EmmanuelMacron have done a really great job thus far with a very important G-7. Lunch with Emmanuel was the best meeting we have yet had. Likewise evening meeting with World Leaders went very well. Progress being made!

Tweet: Thank you both. Sooo nice!

Tweet: The Media is destroying the Free Press! Mark Levin. So True!

Tweet: Such False and Inaccurate reporting thus far on the G-7. The Fake News knows this but they can’t help themselves! Leaving now to have breakfast with Boris J.

Tweet: Great working breakfast this morning with Prime Minister @BorisJohnson at the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz France! #G7Biarritz

Tweet: Happy Birthday Sean!

Tweet: Happy Birthday Regis a truly special man!

Tweet: Rasmussen at 50%. @MediaBuzzFNC &amp; @FoxNews are only getting worse! Now @donnabrazile &amp; others on Fox. Not what it used to be!

Tweet: So @donnabrazile gives Crooked Hillary the Questions and now she’s on @FoxNews!

Tweet: Big Trade Deal just agreed to with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Will be great for our Farmers Ranchers and more. Really big Corn purchase!

Tweet: The question I was asked most today by fellow World Leaders who think the USA is doing so well and is stronger than ever before happens to be “Mr. President why does the American media hate your Country so much? Why are they rooting for it to fail?”

Tweet: Happy Birthday Vince!

Tweet: Jesse &amp; Emma Great News. Congratulations!!!!!

Tweet: USMCA make it bipartisan. Everybody wants it!

Tweet: Thank you Eric. So true!

Tweet: Great meetings at the @G7 in Biarritz France! #G7Biarritz

Tweet: A disgrace!

Tweet: In France we are all laughing at how knowingly inaccurate the U.S. reporting of events and conversations at the G-7 is. These Leaders and many others are getting a major case study of Fake News at it’s finest! They’ve got it all wrong from Iran to China Tariffs to Boris!

Tweet: No we actually had a very good and productive meeting. Nice!

Tweet: My Stock Market gains must be judged from the day after the Election November 9 2016 where the Market went up big after the win and because of the win. Had my opponent won CRASH!

Tweet: Congratulations to Louisiana’s Champions. See you at the White House!

Tweet: .@SteveHiltonx “The Democrats statements about Donald Trump are lies. Here are the Facts.” I will soon be posting the entire segment. Too much positive news too many good things to Tweet. PLEASE BE SURE TO WATCH! Thank you Steve Hilton for being a real pro and not being afraid!

Tweet: Thank you Katie!

Tweet: All Trump Haters and Lovers must watch. Thank you Steve Hilton!

Tweet: Great meeting this morning with President @AlsisiOfficial of Egypt at the Hôtel du Palais in Biarritz France! #G7Summit

Tweet: The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous. I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: Great respect for the fact that President Xi &amp; his Representatives want “calm resolution.” So impressed that they are willing to come out &amp; state the facts so accurately. This is why he is a great leader &amp; representing a great country. Talks are

Tweet: Very productive meeting with Angela Merkel the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany at the #G7Summit in Biarritz France!

Tweet: Just wrapped up a great meeting with my friend Prime Minister @NarendraModi of India at the #G7Summit in Biarritz France!

Tweet: THANK YOU FRANCE🇺🇸🇫🇷#G7Biarritz

Tweet: I agree 100%!

Tweet: Thank you Mark!

Tweet: Just returned to Washington from France and the very successful G-7 only to find that the Fake News is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that I wanted to use Nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore. This is so ridiculous never happened!

Tweet: Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic Giuseppi Conte. Represented Italy powerfully at the G-7. Loves his Country greatly &amp; works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister!

Tweet: I have gotten to know President @jairbolsonaro well in our dealings with Brazil. He is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil - Not easy. He and his country have the full and complete support of the USA!

Tweet: Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic Giuseppe Conte. Represented Italy powerfully at the G-7. Loves his Country greatly &amp; works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister!

Tweet: No bedbugs at Doral. The Radical Left Democrats upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G-7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G-7 spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!

Tweet: The G-7 was a great success for the USA and all. LameStream Media coverage bore NO relationship to what actually happened in France - FAKE NEWS. It was GREAT!

Tweet: Wow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico. Will it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year an all time record of its kind for “anywhere.”

Tweet: 100% Confirmed!

Tweet: The Federal Reserve loves watching our manufacturers struggle with their exports to the benefit of other parts of the world. Has anyone looked at what almost all other countries are doing to take advantage of the good old USA? Our Fed has been calling it wrong for too long!

Tweet: .@JudgeJeanine Pirro is following up her #1 Best Seller with another book that is destined to also be #1 – “Radicals Resistance and Revenge: The Left's Plot to Remake America.” Out today go get it!

Tweet: Looking forward to being with Dan Bishop in two weeks in North Carolina. His opponent believes in Open Borders and Sanctuary Cities and won’t protect your Second Amendment!

Tweet: The G7 in France was so successful and yet when I came back and read the Corrupt and Fake News and watched numerous networks it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the Great G7 event!

Tweet: It is amazing that I can be at 51% with Zogby when the Fake &amp; Corrupt News is almost 100% against me. Great job Mr. President!

Tweet: They do stories so big on Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren’s crowd sizes adding many more people than are actually there and yet my crowds which are far bigger get no coverage at all. Fake News!

Tweet: Axios (whatever that is) sat back and said GEEEEE let’s see what can we make up today to embarrass the President? Then they said “why don’t we say he wants to bomb a hurricane that should do it!” The media in our Country is totally out of control!

Tweet: A made up Radical Left Story about Doral bedbugs but Bret Stephens is loaded up with them! Been calling me wrong for years along with the few remaining Never Trumpers - All Losers!

Tweet: “The infestation of bedbugs at The New York Times office” @OANN was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist Bret Stephens a Conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do! He is now quitting Twitter after being called a “bedbug.” Tough guy!

Tweet: So interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice I am getting on China from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably - In fact they got taken to the cleaners. We are doing very well with China. This has never happened to them before!

Tweet: We are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads as usual to Puerto Rico. FEMA and all others are ready and will do a great job. When they do let them know it and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!

Tweet: Would be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn the leader of Britain’s Labour Party to seek a no-confidence vote against New Prime Minister Boris Johnson especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for &amp; will prove to be “a great one!” Love U.K.

Tweet: Our Federal Reserve cannot “mentally” keep up with the competition - other countries. At the G-7 in France all of the other Leaders were giddy about how low their Interest Costs have gone. Germany is actually “getting paid” to borrow money - ZERO INTEREST PLUS! No Clue Fed!

Tweet: The Wall is going up very fast despite total Obstruction by Democrats in Congress and elsewhere!

Tweet: Another totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly) I would give them a Pardon. This was made up by the Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage - FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: Thank you for the support as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: A sad day for the Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand has dropped out of the Presidential Primary. I’m glad they never found out that she was the one I was really afraid of!

Tweet: The Amazon Washington Post and @CNN just did a Fake Interview on Pardons for Aids on the Wall and that I didn’t think the Wall on the Southern Border was that important to stop Illegals wanting to come into our Country. WRONG vitally important. Will make a BIG impact. So bad!

Tweet: There has never been a time in the history of our Country that the Media was so Fraudulent Fake or Corrupt! When the “Age of Trump” is looked back on many years from now I only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the Fake News!

Tweet: Puerto Rico is in great shape with Hurricane Dorian taking a largely different route than anticipated. Thank you to FEMA first responders and all for working so hard &amp; being so well prepared. A great result! The bad news Florida get ready! Storm is building and will be BIG!

Tweet: Hurricane Dorian looks like it will be hitting Florida late Sunday night. Be prepared and please follow State and Federal instructions it will be a very big Hurricane perhaps one of the biggest!

Tweet: The totally inaccurate reporting by Lawrence O’Donnell for which he has been forced by NBC to apologize is NO DIFFERENT than the horrible corrupt and fraudulent Fake News that I (and many millions of GREAT supporters) have had to put up with for years. So bad for the USA!

Tweet: The Economy is doing GREAT with tremendous upside potential! If the Fed would do what they should we are a Rocket upward!

Tweet: The Farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for Ethanol not even including the E-15 year around which is already done. It will be a giant package get ready! At the same time I was able to save the small refineries from certain closing. Great for all!

Tweet: Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General’s Report. He should be ashamed of himself!

Tweet: Establishment of the U.S. Space Command!

Tweet: General Motors which was once the Giant of Detroit is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again?

Tweet: An idea liked by many?

Tweet: The disastrous IG Report on James Comey shows in the strongest of terms how unfairly I and tens of millions of great people who support me were treated. Our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool. We should be given our stolen time back?

Tweet: The fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is. So many people and experts that I have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course. Comey got Lucky!

Tweet: Bryan Dean Wright former CIA Officer(Dem): “In 2016 we had a Coup. We have to take Comey and others to task. Makes no sense not to prosecute him. Comey got a book deal. I fear for my Country. He tried to kneecap our duly elected president and there are no consequences.” @fox&amp;Fs

Tweet: The Euro is dropping against the Dollar “like crazy” giving them a big export and manufacturing advantage...and the Fed does NOTHING! Our Dollar is now the strongest in history. Sounds good doesn’t it? Except to those (manufacturers) that make product for sale outside the U.S.

Tweet: If the Fed would cut we would have one of the biggest Stock Market increases in a long time. Badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad management...and who can really blame them for doing that? Excuses!

Tweet: The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran. I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.

Tweet: Thanks @RepDougCollins - TRUE!

Tweet: “One of the most disgraceful examples of an abuse of power by a government official…when you read this report…this is a systematic effort to go after Candidate Trump President Elect-Trump and President Trump....you could virtually call this an attempted coup." @RepPeteKing

Tweet: FALLOUT FROM IG'S SCATHING COMEY REPORT

Tweet: This should NEVER happen to another President again!

Tweet: The Great State of North Carolina has EARLY VOTING for a very important Congressional (Ninth) race. Please vote early (now) or on Election Day September 10th for Dan Bishop a great guy. His opponent wants Open Borders Sanctuary Cities &amp; is weak on Crime Military &amp; Vets!

Tweet: Just arrived at Camp David!

Tweet: I am monitoring Hurricane Dorian and receiving frequent briefings and updates. It is important to heed the directions of your State and Local Officials. This is an extremely dangerous storm please prepare and be safe! @FEMA @NWS @NOAA @Readygov @FLSERT

Tweet: Thank you Kevin. Great things are happening at the Border!

Tweet: Great job Thom!

Tweet: One of the greats!

Tweet: Nobody works harder or smarter than Joni!

Tweet: An amazing guy respected by all!

Tweet: Nobody knows more about Healthcare than John. Great guy!

Tweet: Cory is doing a Great job for Colorado!

Tweet: “The IG found that James Comey leaked Classified Documents to his attorneys which can be (is) a violation of the Espionage Act. This is consistent with all the lies that Comey has been spreading. @GreggJarrett @ByronYork @LouDobbs

Tweet: Has anyone noticed that the top shows on @foxnews and cable ratings are those that are Fair (or great) to your favorite President me! Congratulations to @seanhannity for being the number one shoe on Cable Television!

Tweet: While Madeleine Westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement she is a very good person and I don’t think there would ever be reason to use it. She called me yesterday to apologize had a bad night. I fully understood and forgave her! I love Tiffany doing great!

Tweet: A great team working hard!

Tweet: I was right about Comey CROOKED COP!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN which is happening and then KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: Looking like our great South Carolina could get hit MUCH harder than first thought. Georgia and North Carolina also. It’s moving around and very hard to predict except that it is one of the biggest and strongest (and really wide) that we have seen in decades. Be safe!

Tweet: Dan will be GREAT!

Tweet: Has anyone noticed that the top shows on @foxnews and cable ratings are those that are Fair (or great) to your favorite President me! Congratulations to @seanhannity for being the number one show on Cable Television!

Tweet: Just watched Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and many other Democrats wanting to give up on our very successful Trade battle with China which has had its worst Economic year in memory (and getting worse). We are taking in $Billions. Will be big for Farmers and ALL!

Tweet: Enjoy the low gas prices over the Labor Day weekend! My energy policies have made America energy independent while keeping prices low just like a Tax Cut. The Democrats “green” policies will raise your price of gas!

Tweet: “The vindication belongs to the President for firing James Comey. It was clearly the right thing to do. You don’t want an FBI Director with Jim Comey’s ethics.” Jason Riley Wall Street Journal

Tweet: Just briefed by Attorney General Barr about the shootings in Texas. FBI and Law Enforcement is fully engaged. More to follow.

Tweet: “Comey and McCabe (and more) are Dirty Cops.” Joe DiGenova

Tweet: I have not forgotten that when it was announced that I was going to do The Apprentice and when it then became a big hit helping NBC’s failed lineup greatly @DebraMessing came up to me at an Upfront &amp; profusely thanked me even calling me “Sir.” How times have changed!

Tweet: This is only the beginning!

Tweet: In addition to Florida - South Carolina North Carolina Georgia and Alabama will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!

Tweet: Great job by Texas Law Enforcement and First Responders in handling the terrible shooting tragedy yesterday. Thank you also to the FBI @GregAbbott_TX and all others. A very tough and sad situation!

Tweet: Pray for the people in the Bahamas. Being hit like never before Category 5. Almost 200 MPH winds.

Tweet: Since my election many trillions of dollars of worth has been created for our Country and the Stock Market is up over 50%. If you followed the advice of the Failing New York Times columnist Paul Krugman you’d be doing VERY poorly - you’d be angry and hurt. He never got it!

Tweet: “They are liars and in my opinion TRAITORS!” @LouDobbs talking about Comey and his dwindling group of friends.

Tweet: The Amazon Washington Post did a story that I brought racist attacks against the “Squad.” No they brought racist attacks against our Nation. All I do is call them out for the horrible things they have said. The Democrats have become the Party of the Squad!

Tweet: For all of the “geniuses” out there many who have been in other administrations and “taken to the cleaners” by China that want me to get together with the EU and others to go after China Trade practices remember the EU &amp; all treat us VERY unfairly on Trade also. Will change!

Tweet: Germany and so many other countries have negative interest rates “they get paid for loaning money” and our Federal Reserve fails to act! Remember these are also our weak currency competitors!

Tweet: Based on the IG Report the whole Witch Hunt against me and my administration was a giant and illegal SCAM. The House of Representatives should now get back to work on drug prices healthcare infrastructure and all else. The Mueller Report showed No Collusion No Obstruction!

Tweet: @NHC_Atlantic

Tweet: The U.S. may be getting a little bit lucky with respect to Hurricane Dorian but please don’t let down your guard. As it heads up the coast lots of very bad and unpredictable things can happen! On the other hand the Bahamas have been devastated. We are sending crews to help!

Tweet: At the request of Senator Thom Tillis I am getting the North Carolina Emergency Declaration completed and signed tonight. Hope you won’t need it!

Tweet: The truth is that we have a nation that is disgusted with the FBI. We have a crisis of confidence in the number one law enforcement agency in this country (thanks Comey!). @LouDobbs “It’s a scandal.” @AlanDersh

Tweet: “I am so tired of hearing the rationalization of the Left in the country because they hate Donald Trump. Inexplicably and without foundation they choose to hate America. The Democrats have truly become the party of hate.” @LouDobbs

Tweet: 8 FACTS that #FakeNewsCNN will ignore in tonight’s “Climate Forum”

Tweet: 7. The badly flawed Paris Climate Agreement protects the polluters hurts Americans and cost a fortune. NOT ON MY WATCH!8. I want crystal clean water and the cleanest and the purest air on the planet – we’ve now got that!

Tweet: 6. The Democrats’ destructive “environmental” proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump. Don't the Democrats care about fighting American poverty?

Tweet: 4. The U.S. now leads the world in energy production...BUT... 5. Who's got the world's cleanest and safest air and water? AMERICA!

Tweet: 1. Which country has the largest carbon emission reduction?AMERICA!2. Who has dumped the most carbon into the air? CHINA!3. 91% of the world’s population are exposed to air pollution above the World Health Organization’s suggested level. NONE ARE IN THE U.S.A.!

Tweet: State Rep Greg Murphy is running for Congress in North Carolina District 3. We really need Greg in Washington. He is great w/ the Military our Vets &amp; your 2A. Strong on Crime and the Border has had my Total Endorsement for a long time. Please vote for Greg on September 10th!

Tweet: This was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!

Tweet: Thank you Terrence. Best Employment Numbers In History for African Americans!

Tweet: Thank you Rad - looking great!

Tweet: Alabama was going to be hit or grazed and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That’s why they’re the Fake News!

Tweet: Really Good Jobs Numbers!

Tweet: Just as I said Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it!

Tweet: I was with you all the way Alabama. The Fake News Media was not!

Tweet: Just talked to Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina as Hurricane Dorian ominously comes up the East Coast. We are monitoring it at the @WhiteHouse ready to assist via our great team over at @FEMA who are already on site. We are with you all the way North Carolina. BE SAFE!

Tweet: Just spoke to Governor @HenryMcMaster of South Carolina regarding Hurricane Dorian. I informed Henry that we are monitoring South Carolina and stand by ready to assist. Be safe everyone we are totally with you!

Tweet: Just got off the phone with Governor Brian Kemp (@GovKemp) of Georgia. Happy to hear that things are looking good for everyone. I stand by ready to assist along with our great team at @FEMA – we’re with you ALL THE WAY!

Tweet: Great job done by @GovRonDesantis @SenRickScott Senator @MarcoRubio and all of the those from Florida that were so brilliantly involved including @FEMA @USCG Law Enforcement and First Responders. Thank you all!

Tweet: Looking forward to watching @SarahHuckabee Sanders tomorrow morning on @FoxandFriends by far the #1 rated show on Morning Cable at 8:30am. Sarah will be an incredible addition to @FoxNews!

Tweet: DACA will be going before the Supreme Court. It is a document that even President Obama didn’t feel he had the legal right to sign - he signed it anyway! Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must based on the law a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!

Tweet: I agree with @jimcramer the Fed should lower rates. They were WAY too early to raise and Way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didn’t exactly help either. Where did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well you can’t win them all!

Tweet: Congratulations to @edhenry and his sister on a great success. What a wonderful thing to do!

Tweet: Great interview of Sarah Sanders by @foxandfriends. She is a terrific person with a great future!

Tweet: Our great @JudgeJeanine has just written a book that will add to the tremendous success of her last number one best seller. It’s called “Radicals Resistance and Revenge The Left’s Plot To Remake America.” It is a FANTASTIC book. Go get it! @foxandfriends

Tweet: Larry Kudlow on @Varneyco now!

Tweet: Great job by FEMA Law Enforcement First Responders U.S. Coast Guard and ALL! Keep going we all appreciate what you are doing!

Tweet: The Economy is great. The only thing adding to “uncertainty” is the Fake News!

Tweet: “China is eating the Tariffs.” Billions pouring into USA. Targeted Patriot Farmers getting massive Dollars from the incoming Tariffs! Good Jobs Numbers No Inflation(Fed). China having worst year in decades. Talks happening good for all!

Tweet: China just enacted a major stimulus plan. With all the Tariffs THEY are paying to the USA Billions and Billions of Dollars they need it! In the meantime our Federal Reserve sits back and does NOTHING!

Tweet: I want to congratulate @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and all Republicans. Today I signed the 160th Federal Judge to the Bench. Within a short period of time we will be at over 200 Federal Judges including many in the Appellate Courts &amp; two great new U.S. Supreme Court Justices!

Tweet: The Washington Post’s @PhilipRucker (Mr. Off the Record) &amp; @AshleyRParker two nasty lightweight reporters shouldn’t even be allowed on the grounds of the White House because their reporting is so DISGUSTING &amp; FAKE. Also add the appointment of MANY Federal Judges this Summer!

Tweet: Congratulations to @JudgeJeanine Pirro on having again the Number One Best Selling Book!

Tweet: Maria &amp; John understood the dishonesty &amp; deception from the very beginning!

Tweet: North Carolina vote for Dan Bishop tomorrow. We need him badly in Washington! His opponent is a far left Sanctuary Cities supporter.

Tweet: House Republicans should allow Chairs of Committees to remain for longer than 6 years. It forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving. The Dems have unlimited terms. While that has its own problems it is a better way to go. Fewer people in the end will leave!

Tweet: 94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party a record. Thank you!

Tweet: The Trump Administrations has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our Country. We get ZERO media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that’s all that is important!

Tweet: I know nothing about an Air Force plane landing at an airport (which I do not own and have nothing to do with) near Turnberry Resort (which I do own) in Scotland and filling up with fuel with the crew staying overnight at Turnberry (they have good taste!). NOTHING TO DO WITH ME

Tweet: I had nothing to do with the decision of our great @VP Mike Pence to stay overnight at one of the Trump owned resorts in Doonbeg Ireland. Mike’s family has lived in Doonbeg for many years and he thought that during his very busy European visit he would stop and see his family!

Tweet: The Trump Administration has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our Country. We get ZERO media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that’s all that is important!

Tweet: We have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers the finest on earth. Over the last four days we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!

Tweet: THANK YOU @USCG! GREAT JOB!!

Tweet: Great job by the U.S. Coast Guard!

Tweet: Last night in North Carolina was incredible!

Tweet: NORTH CAROLINA VOTE FOR DAN BISHOP TODAY. WE NEED HIM BADLY IN WASHINGTON!

Tweet: ABC/Washington Post Poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 Election. When my lawyers protested they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by Election Day. It was a Fake Poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets. Sad!

Tweet: One of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the Fake and Corrupt News Media is the phony Polling Information they put out. Many of these polls are fixed or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad. Internal polling looks great the best ever!

Tweet: Vote today for Dan Bishop. Will be great for North Carolina and our Country!

Tweet: Incredible progress being made at the Southern Border!

Tweet: One down one to go – Greg Murphy is projected to win in the Great State of North Carolina! #NC03

Tweet: Excellent interview by @CondoleezzaRice on @MarthaMaccallum on @FoxNews. Very interesting and secure perspective on life.

Tweet: I am pleased to endorse Governor Mike Parson of Missouri. He is very Popular Strong and knows what he is doing – he gets it! Based on the fact that Mike has announced he will run again in 2020 for Governor Mike Parson has my Complete and Total Endorsement!

Tweet: Senator Ben Sasse has done a wonderful job representing the people of Nebraska. He is great with our Vets the Military and your very important Second Amendment. Strong on Crime and the Border Ben has my Complete and Total Endorsement!

Tweet: Dan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help we changed his strategy together and he ran a great race. Big Rally last night. Now it looks like he is going to win. @CNN &amp; @MSNBC are moving their big studio equipment and to talent out. Stay tuned!

Tweet: Greg Murphy is a big winner in North Carolina 03. Much bigger margins than originally anticipated. Congratulations Greg!

Tweet: BIG NIGHT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL!

Tweet: .@CNN &amp; @MSNBC were all set to have a BIG victory until Dan Bishop won North Carolina 09. Now you will hear them barely talk about or cover the race. Fake News never wins!

Tweet: Alice @alicetweet Stewart: Thank you for the nice words while on @CNN concerning the TWO big Republican Congressional victories. You’d be great on a network with much higher ratings. Keep up the good work!

Tweet: Greg Murphy won big 62% to 37% in North Carolina 03 &amp; the Fake News barely covered the race. The win was far bigger than anticipated - there was just nothing the Fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory. So we had TWO BIG VICTORIES tonight Greg &amp; Dan!

Tweet: “China suspends Tariffs on some U.S. products. Being hit very hard supply chains breaking up as many companies move or look to move to other countries. Much more expensive to China than originally thought.” @CNBC @JoeSquawk

Tweet: If it weren’t for the never ending Fake News about me and with all that I have done (more than any other President in the first 2 1/2 years!) I would be leading the “Partners” of the LameStream Media by 20 points. Sorry but true!

Tweet: Leaving the White House soon to speak at the Pentagon. My great honor!

Tweet: The Wall is going up very fast despite total Obstruction by Democrats in Congress and elsewhere!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: Thank you Brandon!

Tweet: European Central Bank acting quickly Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points. They are trying and succeeding in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar hurting U.S. exports.... And the Fed sits and sits and sits. They get paid to borrow money while we are paying interest!

Tweet: Who the hell is Joy-Ann Reid? Never met her she knows ZERO about me has NO talent and truly doesn’t have the “it” factor needed for success in showbiz. Had a bad reputation and now works for the Comcast/NBC losers making up phony stories about me. Low Ratings. Fake News!

Tweet: 94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party! Tuesday night in the Great State of North Carolina proved that high and very beautiful number correct.

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: I’m OK with that!

Tweet: The Taliban has never been hit harder than it is being hit right now. Killing 12 people including one great American soldier was not a good idea. There are much better ways to set up a negotiation. The Taliban knows they made a big mistake and they have no idea how to recover!

Tweet: Amazing!

Tweet: That is true and the USA is Winning Again!

Tweet: My great honor!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: Thank you Billy!

Tweet: All based on NOTHING! The Dems can’t get anything positive done and probably don’t want to.

Tweet: Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner the LameStream Media are after Brett Kavanaugh again talking loudly of their favorite word impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!

Tweet: Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for liable or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!

Tweet: Thank you @foxandfriends and @RepMarkMeadows. Great interview!

Tweet: Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!

Tweet: Can’t let Brett Kavanaugh give Radical Left Democrat (Liberal Plus) Opinions based on threats of Impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?) false allegations and lies. This is the game they play. Fake and Corrupt News is working overtime! #ProtectKavanaugh

Tweet: I am fighting the Fake (Corrupt) News the Deep State the Democrats and the few remaining Republicans In Name Only (RINOS who are on mouth to mouth resuscitation) with the help of some truly great Republicans and others. We are Winning big (150th Federal Judge this week)!

Tweet: Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed!

Tweet: PLENTY OF OIL!

Tweet: Here we go again with General Motors and the United Auto Workers. Get together and make a deal!

Tweet: The Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran “No Conditions.” That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).

Tweet: “We cannot have what happened to this President happen again.” Joe DiGenova. “It is time for Justice to come barreling in.” @LouDobbs Can you imagine that with everything going on in this World the Witch Hunt though on a respirator is still whimpering along. A disgrace!

Tweet: Because we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you Mr. President!) we are a net Energy Exporter &amp; now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We don’t need Middle Eastern Oil &amp; Gas &amp; in fact have very few tankers there but will help our Allies!

Tweet: “The New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim.” @foxandfriends The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner the Dems.

Tweet: “What’s happening to Justice Kavanaugh is a disgrace. This guy is not a good man he is a great man. He has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him a disgrace!” Dan Bongino @foxandfriends

Tweet: Just Out: “Kavanaugh accuser doesn’t recall incident.” @foxandfriends DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued!

Tweet: Remember when Iran shot down a drone saying knowingly that it was in their “airspace” when in fact it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We’ll see?

Tweet: “Democrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done.” Governor John Sununu @FoxNews @BillHemmer The big questions are will they “move the goalposts” and is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? I hope NOT on both counts but I’ll be able to figure it out!

Tweet: In a short while I will be presenting the New York @Yankees @MarianoRivera the greatest relief pitcher (Closer!) of all time with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse!

Tweet: Congratulations @MarianoRivera!

Tweet: “How many stories are wrong? Almost all of the stories the New York Times has done are inaccurate and wrong.” @greggutfeld The New York Times should close its doors and throw away the keys. The women mentioned in the Kavanaugh story said she didn’t even remember the event.

Tweet: Such a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski! Thank you Corey! @CLewandowski_

Tweet: The New York Times is now blaming an editor for the horrible mistake they made in trying to destroy or influence Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It wasn’t the editor the Times knew everything. They are sick and desperate losing in so many ways!

Tweet: No Lindsey it was a sign of strength that some people just don’t understand!

Tweet: As Corey Lewandowski stated very clearly yesterday in front of the House Judiciary Committee President Trump didn’t do anything wrong or illegal. But they all know that. The Democrats are hurting our Country and getting nothing done. Shameful! @CLewandowski_ @foxandfriends

Tweet: The Witch Hunt is the greatest political scam in U.S. history! #MAGA

Tweet: Thank you Corey!

Tweet: Great!

Tweet: Dummy Beto made it much harder to make a deal. Convinced many that Dems just want to take your guns away. Will continue forward!

Tweet: Happy 72nd Birthday to our GREAT @USAirForce! #HBDUSAF

Tweet: Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No “guts” no sense no vision! A terrible communicator!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: All Polls and some brand new Polls show very little support for impeachment. Such a waste of time especially with sooo much good that could be done including prescription drug price reduction healthcare infrastructure etc.

Tweet: GREAT progress on the Border Wall!

Tweet: Another Fake News story out there - It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!

Tweet: Presidential Harassment!

Tweet: Because of my Administration drug prices are down for the first time in almost 50 years — but the American people need Congress to help. I like Sen. Grassley’s drug pricing bill very much and it’s great to see Speaker Pelosi’s bill today. Let’s get it done in a bipartisan way!

Tweet: Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook in the Oval Office today.

Tweet: Great news. @MariaBartiromo just renewed her deal with Fox. I don’t care how much they paid her they got a beautiful bargain. Congratulations to both!

Tweet: Oh no really big political news perhaps the biggest story in years! Part time Mayor of New York City @BilldeBlasio who was polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth has shocking dropped out of the Presidential race. NYC is devastated he’s coming home!

Tweet: 🇺🇸🇦🇺

Tweet: Thank you working hard!

Tweet: Rachel Campos-Duffy has written a wonderful book for children “Paloma Wants To Be Lady Freedom.” She and her husband Sean Duffy have done so much for our Country. Buy this book - great for the kids!

Tweet: I want to express my gratitude to America’s magnificent @FLOTUS for tonight’s exquisite evening where we celebrated more than a century of loyal and devoted friendship between🇺🇸🇦🇺Both of our nations are blessed by uncommon courage unfailing commitment and unyielding character!

Tweet: This is the real and only story!

Tweet: Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone “bust” on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden. Will fail again!

Tweet: Some of the best Economic Numbers our Country has ever experienced are happening right now. This is despite a Crooked and Demented Deep State and a probably illegal Democrat/Fake News Media Partnership the likes of which the world has never seen. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: “They’re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal.” @PeterScheeizer The problem is “Trump” did nothing wrong!

Tweet: “The pretend Ukraine scandal is an another malicious seditious effort to protect the Obama/Clinton gang. Criminal classified leaks and spying targeting Trump — again.” @TomFitton

Tweet: “They’re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal.” @PeterSchweizer The problem is “Trump” did nothing wrong!

Tweet: “Ukraine Foreign Minister disputes reports of any pressure from Trump. This conversation was long friendly and it touched on many questions.” @NBCNews Correct. If your looking for something done wrong just look at the tape of Sleepy Joe. He is being protected by the Media!

Tweet: The LameStream Media had a very bad week. They pushed numerous phony stories and got caught especially The Failing New York Times which has lost more money over the last 10 years than any paper in history and The Amazon Washington Post. They are The Enemy of the People!

Tweet: “When someone gets nominated overwhelmingly and then wins the Election as he did then he gets to set the National Agenda. The press is just outrages. This @nytimes story is the most irresponsible thing I’ve ever seen.” @EdRollins @LouDobbs I agree. They also lose too much!

Tweet: “The real story involves Hunter Biden going around the world and collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign oligarchs.” Peter Schweizer Laura Ingraham Hunter made a fortune in Ukraine and in China. He knew nothing about Energy or anything else.

Tweet: “Go across the world and you’ll see either very low interest rates or negative rates. The President wants to be competitive with these other countries on this but I don’t think he’ll fire Jay Powell (even if I should!).” We should always be paying less interest than others!

Tweet: I go along with Joe!

Tweet: “They are trying to destroy and influence Justice Kavanaugh a very good man.” @LindseyGrahamSC 100% correct and they should be fully exposed for what they are!

Tweet: Will be in Houston to be with my friend. Will be a great day in Texas!

Tweet: “The @nytimes is trying to make someone (Justice Kavanaugh) into an evil person when they don’t have the information to back it up. It is a false hoax.” @MZHemingway @MediaBuzzFNC Zero people were fired at the Times. Why?

Tweet: Look forward to being with our great India loving community!

Tweet: She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!

Tweet: True. A wonderful meeting!

Tweet: Hopefully they will work it out and quickly!

Tweet: THANK YOU!

Tweet: The Democrats are so focused on hurting the Republican Party and the President that they are unable to get anything done because of it including legislation on gun safety lowering of prescription drug prices infrastructure etc. So bad for our Country!

Tweet: Such an important day at the United Nations so much work and so much success and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our Country!

Tweet: Pelosi Nadler Schiff and of course Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?

Tweet: They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!

Tweet: PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!

Tweet: Secretary of State Pompeo recieved permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don’t know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!

Tweet: “Attorney For Anti-Trump ‘Whistleblower’ Worked For Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer”

Tweet: Thank you @LouDobbs and @JudgeJeanine!

Tweet: Great new book by the brilliant Andrew McCarthy BALL OF COLLUSION THE PLOT TO RIG AN ELECTION AND DESTROY A PRESIDENCY. Get it and some other great new books which I will soon be recommending. They tell you about the Crooked Pols and the Witch Hunt that has now been exposed!

Tweet: There has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have. The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: “The Democrats have been talking about Impeaching Donald Trump since before he was inaugurated.” @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends And for no reason other than the great success we are having with the Economy the Military Vets Tax and Regulation Cuts HealthCare and so much more!

Tweet: Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should a perfect call - got them by surprise!

Tweet: “Democrats wrote to the Ukrainian government in May 2018 urging it to continue investigations into President Donald Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign — collusion later found NOT TO EXIST.”

Tweet: “You don’t see a direct quid pro quo in this.” @BretBaier

Tweet: “He (President Trump) didn’t specifically mention the explicit quid pro quo of…unless you investigate this…we’re going to withhold military aid to you.” Pamela Brown

Tweet: Thank you Jim!

Tweet: THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!

Tweet: THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ALL THAT IT STANDS FOR. STICK TOGETHER PLAY THEIR GAME AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE!

Tweet: “Is their a case for impeachment? Absolutely not!” There is no high crimes or misdemeanors no treason no extortion no treason.” RD Robert Ray respected

Tweet: “Is there a case for impeachment? Absolutely not! There is no high crime or misdemeanor no crime no extortion no treason.” Robert Ray @FoxNews

Tweet: That and many other reasons is why Republicans will win North Carolina!

Tweet: A whistleblower with second hand information? Another Fake News Story! See what was said on the very nice no pressure call. Another Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Adam Schiff has zero credibility. Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party!

Tweet: Liddle’ Adam Schiff who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the Republican Party and President has just said that the Whistleblower even though he or she only had second hand information “is credible.” How can that be with zero info and a known bias. Democrat Scam!

Tweet: Congratulations to my friend @SenShelby our powerful Appropriations Chairman for his hard work on many strong bills that continue to rebuild our military invest in border security and many other priorities. Good work and keep fighting you are winning!

Tweet: No one has done more behind the scenes for STRONG BORDER SECURITY than @SenCapito. Her bill passed Committee today with $5B for the BORDER WALL. West Virginia is a great State and Shelley gets it done. Keep it up!

Tweet: The President of Ukraine said that he was NOT pressured by me to do anything wrong. Can’t have better testimony than that! As V.P. Biden had his son on the other hand take out millions of dollars by strong arming the Ukrainian President. Also looted millions from China. Bad!

Tweet: Will be a GREAT and very accurate show tonight by @seanhannity on @foxnews (9:00 PM). Will play my full statement from Air Force One!

Tweet: So many lies by Sleepy Joe and the Do Nothing Democrats!

Tweet: To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is I used the word Liddle’ not Liddle in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle’ Adam Schiff. Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!

Tweet: Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet. I said of course NO!

Tweet: “IT WAS A PERFECT CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT!”

Tweet: Rep. Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions. He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!

Tweet: The Democrats are now to be known as the DO NOTHING PARTY!

Tweet: Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all. In addition all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else a leaker or spy feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?

Tweet: If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!

Tweet: I AM DRAINING THE SWAMP!

Tweet: Thank you to General McMaster. Just more Fake News!

Tweet: Voter I.D. is the best way. Go for it Doug!

Tweet: Can you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages people like Nadler Schiff AOC Plus 3 and many more had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me. Oh well maybe next time!

Tweet: PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: They are trying to stop ME because I am fighting for YOU!

Tweet: WOW they got caught. End the Witch Hunt now!

Tweet: It is disgraceful what the Do Nothing Democrats are doing (the Impeachment Scam) but it is also disgraceful what they are NOT doing namely the USMCA vote Prescription Drug Price Reduction Gun Safety Infrastructure and much more!

Tweet: The only people that don’t like my conversation with the new Ukrainian President are those that heard Rep. Adam Schiff read a made up and totally fraudulent statement to the House and public words that I did not say but that he fabricated (&amp; admitted to this fabrication). Sick!

Tweet: The Fake News doesn’t dare mention the corrupt Democrats!

Tweet: “These are Trumped-Up Charges.” @PeteHegseth @foxandfriends

Tweet: Will happen to all of those seeking unlawful impeachment in 50 Trump type Districts. We will win big!

Tweet: So great Mark!

Tweet: Investigating Corruption is correct!

Tweet: Wishing a Happy New Year to all of those celebrating Rosh Hashanah in America Israel and around the World!

Tweet: These Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats are doing great harm to our Country. They are lying &amp; cheating like never before in our Country’s history in order to destabilize the United States of America &amp; it’s upcoming 2020 Election. They &amp; the Fake News Media are Dangerous &amp; Bad!

Tweet: “State Department has stepped up Hillary Clinton Email probe.” @foxandfriends You mean the 33000 Emails that she has deleted and acid washed so they can never be found even though she said that all 33000 pertained only to her daughter’s wedding and her Yoga!

Tweet: “This is about proving that Donald Trump was framed by the Democrats.” @RudyGiuliani

Tweet: The Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!

Tweet: “China Trade Turmoil: China Urging a CALM AND RATIONAL Solution.” @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness China is doing very poorly while the USA under your favorite President’s leadership continues to soar to new heights - and despite the Do Nothing Democrats we have just begun!

Tweet: The Fake Whistleblower complaint is not holding up. It is mostly about the call to the Ukrainian President which in the name of transparency I immediately released to Congress &amp; the public. The Whistleblower knew almost nothing its 2ND HAND description of the call is a fraud!

Tweet: Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE &amp; terrible statement pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukrainian President and read it aloud to Congress and the American people. It bore NO relationship to what I said on the call. Arrest for Treason?

Tweet: Again the President of the Ukraine said THERE WAS NO (ZERO) PRESSURE PUT ON HIM BY ME. End of case!

Tweet: Again the President of Ukraine said there was NO (ZERO) PRESSURE PUT ON HIM BY ME. Case closed!

Tweet: WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!

Tweet: #FakeWhistleblower

Tweet: Very simple! I was looking for Corruption and also why Germany France and others in the European Union don’t do more for Ukraine. Why is it always the USA that does so much and puts up so much money for Ukraine and other countries? By the way the Bidens were corrupt!

Tweet: The Fake News Media wants to stay as far away as possible from the Ukraine and China deals made by the Bidens. A Corrupt Media is so bad for our Country! In actuality the Media may be even more Corrupt than the Bidens which is hard to do!

Tweet: It was my Great Honor to attend this mornings Welcome Ceremony for the 20th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley!

Tweet: Great job just in time!

Tweet: Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People’s Republic of China!

Tweet: “The congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT unless you heard Liddle’ Adam Schiff’s fraudulently made up version of the call. This is just another Fake News Media together with their partner the Democrat Party HOAX!

Tweet: As I predicted Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong especially relative to ALL other currencies that our manufacturers are being negatively affected. Fed Rate too high. They are their own worst enemies they don’t have a clue. Pathetic!

Tweet: Why isn’t Congressman Adam Schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress as if this statement which was very dishonest and bad for me was directly made by the President of the United States? This should never be allowed!

Tweet: The Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!

Tweet: Louisiana Republicans must go out and vote REPUBLICAN in your Governor’s race. A Republican will win if you can force a runoff! Early voting has started. Your 2nd Amendment and much else is at stake.

Tweet: I won the right to be a presidential candidate in California in a major Court decision handed down yesterday. It was filed against me by the Radical Left Governor of that State to tremendous Media hoopla. The VICTORY however was barely covered by the Fake News. No surprise!

Tweet: Massive sections of The Wall are being built at our Southern Border. It is going up rapidly and built to the highest standards and specifications of the Border Patrol experts. It is actually an amazing structure! Our U.S. Military is doing a GREAT job.

Tweet: Congressman Adam Schiff should resign for the Crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the President of Ukraine (it was perfect) fraudulently fabricating a statement of the President of the United States and reading it to Congress as though mine! He is sick!

Tweet: All the Do Nothing Democrats are focused on is Impeaching the President for having a very good conversation with the Ukrainian President. I knew that many people were listening even have a transcript. They have been at this “stuff” from the day I got elected. Bad for Country!

Tweet: #DONOTHINGDEMS

Tweet: Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moot stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!

Tweet: Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!

Tweet: All of this impeachment nonsense which is going nowhere is driving the Stock Market and your 401K’s down. But that is exactly what the Democrats want to do. They are willing to hurt the Country with only the 2020 Election in mind!

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices &amp; working on the desperately needed USMCA. She is incapable of working on either. It is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment. The Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud!

Tweet: Democrats are trying to undo the Election regardless of FACTS!

Tweet: Adam Schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains honor and strength of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. For a lowlife like Schiff who completely fabricated my words and read them to Congress as though they were said by me to demean a First in Class at West Point is SAD!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country not wasting everyone’s time and energy on BULLSHIT which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016 223-306. Get a better candidate this time you’ll need it!

Tweet: “Schiff House Intel Chairman Got Early Account of Whistle-Blower’s Accusations” SCHIFF IS A FRAUD!

Tweet: LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats don’t have time to get it done!

Tweet: AOC is a Wack Job!

Tweet: This isn’t about a Campaign this is about Corruption on a massive scale!

Tweet: “They (Do Nothing Dems) are trying to nullify an election...” Joe diGenova

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi today on @GMA actually said that Adam Schiffty Schiff didn’t fabricate my words in a major speech before Congress. She either had no idea what she was saying in other words lost it or she lied. Even Clinton lover @GStephanopoulos strongly called her out. Sue her?

Tweet: The Washington Times “Ukraine envoy blows ‘massive hole’ into Democrat accusations. Republicans at hearing find no Trump Pressure.” The Ukrainian President also strongly stated that NO pressure was put on him. Case Closed!

Tweet: As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!

Tweet: Breaking News: Unemployment Rate at 3.5% drops to a 50 YEAR LOW. Wow America lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!).

Tweet: The Whistleblower who had the facts wrong about the phone call reached out and more to the Democrat controlled House Intelligence Committee. Schiff never told us about this!

Tweet: “When your making an unsubstantiated statement that the President is making a claim having to do with quid pro quo this witness has blown a big hole into that statement. The Ambassador put a dagger in the heart of Schiffs fairytale.” Rep. Lee Zeldin

Tweet: The Media is “Fixed” and Corrupt. It bears no relationship to the truth. The @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost are pure fiction. Totally dishonest reporting!

Tweet: The so-called Whistleblower’s account of my perfect phone call is “way off” not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!

Tweet: Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one and my statement on China pertained to corruption not politics. If Mitt worked this hard on Obama he could have won. Sadly he choked!

Tweet: Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous “ass” who has been fighting me from the beginning except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him) and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn’t give it to him). He is so bad for R’s!

Tweet: THIS IS THE REAL STORY! @GreggJarrett

Tweet: Schiff is a FRAUD! @dbongino

Tweet: Not only are the Do Nothing Democrats interfering in the 2020 Election but they are continuing to interfere in the 2016 Election. They must be stopped!

Tweet: No Kevin Jeff Flake is better!

Tweet: So Crooked Hillary Clinton can delete and acid wash 33000 emails AFTER getting a Subpoena from the United States Congress but I can’t make one totally appropriate telephone call to the President of Ukraine? Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Mitt get off the stage you’ve had your turn (twice)!

Tweet: Gerry Baker of @WSJatLarge “Do you think what you’ve seen rises to the level of impeachment?” Ken Starr Clinton Special Prosecutor. “I don’t!”

Tweet: Unemployment Rate just dropped to 3.5% the lowest in more that 50 years. Is that an impeachable event for your President?

Tweet: .@60Minutes “forgot” to report that we are helping the great farmers of the USA to the tune of 28 Billion Dollars for the last two years paid for out of Tariffs paid to the United States by China for targeting the farmer. They devalued their currency therefore paying the cost!

Tweet: We just WON the big court case on Net Neutrality Rules! A great win for the future and speed of the internet. Will lead to many big things including 5G. Congratulations to the FCC and its Chairman Ajit Pai!

Tweet: “IG: DECLASSIFIED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS THE WHISTLEBLOWER.” @foxandfriends But why are people surprised? The “partisan” Whistleblower was very wrong on what was said on my perfect “no pressure” call with the Ukrainian President. Bring in another Whistleblower from the bench!

Tweet: “Incomes much higher under Trump than Bush Obama.” @foxandfriends And almost everything else is better also (except I am driving the Deep State and the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats CRAZY)!

Tweet: The Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump. A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!

Tweet: The lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!

Tweet: I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how &amp; why she deleted 33000 Emails AFTER getting “C” Subpoena!

Tweet: Thank you to Lt. Bob Kroll of the great Minneapolis Police Department for your kind words on @foxandfriends. The Police are fighting the Radical Left Mayor and his ridiculous Uniform Ban. Actually I LOVE the Cops for Trump shirts. Want to bring some home. I am with you 100%!!!!

Tweet: Get your great T-Shirts “Cops for Trump” at REALLY NICE! Thank you to Minneapolis Police Officers &amp; Union! @foxandfriends

Tweet: Hasn’t Adam Schiff been fully discredited by now? Do we have to continue listening to his lies?

Tweet: Friday night in Louisiana will be Great. Big crowd expected. Republicans must get out and vote for either of our two incredible candidates (@DocAbraham &amp; @EddieRispone) so we can stop Left Leaning Governor John Bel Edwards from getting over 50%. We will easily win the runoff!

Tweet: The U.S. Border is SECURE!

Tweet: This is just the beginning thank you to @ByronYork!

Tweet: Big Rally in Louisiana on Friday night. Must force a runoff with a Liberal Democrat Governor John Bel Edwards who has let your Taxes and Car Insurance get too high and will never protect your 2nd Amendment. Vote for one of our two great Republicans on Saturday force a runoff!

Tweet: Gasoline Prices in the State of California are MUCH HIGHER than anywhere else in the Nation ($2.50 vs. $4.50). I guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just aren’t doing the trick! Don’t worry California relief is on the way. The State doesn’t get it!

Tweet: Wow Just Breaking: “The (big deal) Whistleblower had a ‘PROFESSIONAL TIE’ to 2020 Democratic Candidate.” Washington Examiner @ByronYork In other words was working with someone who was potentially running against me. Why wasn’t this reported by the ICIG? A Witch Hunt Scam!

Tweet: So amazing!

Tweet: A Total Scam by the Do Nothing Democrats. For the good of the Country this Wirch Hunt should end now!

Tweet: He should be Impeached for Fraud!

Tweet: So make all Member Countries pay not just the United States!

Tweet: Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East. Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars for us are ending!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats are Con Artists only looking to hurt the Republican Party and President. Their total focus is 2020 nothing more and nothing less. The good news is that WE WILL WIN!!!!

Tweet: The so-called Whistleblower before knowing I was going to release the exact Transcript stated that my call with the Ukrainian President was “crazy frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security.” This is a very big Lie. Read the Transcript!

Tweet: They don’t have a clue but I do. The USA is doing great despite the Fed!

Tweet: Great support from GOP in fighting the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats!

Tweet: But we are now for the first time giving companies a better alternative!

Tweet: So true Don and this was a big lie. Look what happened to Friends of Trump for less. Can’t let this pass!

Tweet: Adam Schiff is a disgrace to our Country!

Tweet: Why doesn’t the ICIG do something about this Scam? He should have never let it start a Dem Hoax!

Tweet: True. Should have never been there in the first place!

Tweet: Crooked Hillary should try it again!

Tweet: So why is someone a good or great President if they needed to Spy on someone else’s Campaign in order to win (that didn’t work out so well) and if they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far) handing them all to me to chose. Will have 182 soon!

Tweet: Only 25 percent want the President Impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong. It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!

Tweet: So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden who with his son Hunter and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!

Tweet: Sleepy Joe Biden!

Tweet: “I don’t think it’s a Whistleblower at all. I think this is an anonymous source for the Democratic Staff in the House of Representatives. This is an insult to real Whistleblowers. Actual Whistleblowers go on to have their whole lives upended.” John Kiriakou @TuckerCarlson

Tweet: A different take!

Tweet: Impeached for what having created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country building our strongest ever Military Cutting Taxes too much?

Tweet: In case the Kurds or Turkey lose control the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria known as the Beetles out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S. They are the worst of the worst!

Tweet: “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters Thursday his controversial July call with President Trump involved no bribe blackmail or quid pro quo as impeachment-minded Democrats claim.” This should immediately end the talk of impeachment!

Tweet: Where is Hunter Biden? He has disappeared while the Fake News protects his Crooked daddy!

Tweet: Thank you to @OANN One America News for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting. It is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new consistent and powerful VOICE! See you tonight at the Big Rally in Minneapolis.

Tweet: The President of the Ukraine just stated again in the strongest of language that President Trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong. He used the strongest language possible. That should end this Democrat Scam but it won’t because the Dems &amp; Media are FIXED!

Tweet: Why isn’t the IG investigating his so-called Whistleblower? All bad info!

Tweet: I will be in Louisiana tonight (Love it!) to get Republicans to vote for either of our two great Republican Candidates and force a run off with John Bel Edwards who has done a really poor job of tax cutting car insurance cost (worst in USA) &amp; is suspect on your 2nd Amendment!

Tweet: One of the great things about the China Deal is the fact that for various reasons we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex Congressional Approval Process. When the deal is fully negotiated I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean!

Tweet: Will be with our two GREAT Senators @SenJohnKennedy &amp; @SenBillCassidy tonight in Louisiana. These two hard working really smart men love their Country and love their State. We will hopefully add a Great New Republican Governor to the beautiful Louisiana mix! See you tonight!

Tweet: What a disgraceful legal system for this guy to still be around after all of these years. A vicious killer who destroyed so many great people &amp; families!

Tweet: Is he leaving due to bad ratings or some other less important reason?

Tweet: WHERE’S HUNTER?

Tweet: So funny to watch Steve Kerr grovel and pander when asked a simple question about China. He chocked and looks weak and pathetic. Don’t want him at the White House!

Tweet: “I never saw so many subpoenas!” @ShannonBream @FoxNews The Democrats have gone Crazy. Just read the Transcript or listen to the New Ukraine President’s statement NO PRESSURE! This is a Democrat Con Job. Impeach Schiff for FRAUD!

Tweet: Louisiana REPUBLICANS thank you for a great evening. Get out TOMORROW and VOTE REPUBLICAN! Send the Radical Democrat establishment a loud and clear message that you are going to FIRE your Democrat Governor John Bel Edwards and send a Great Republican to the Governor’s Mansion!

Tweet: LOUISIANA — Tomorrow you will head to the polls and VOTE to REPLACE Liberal Democrat John Bel Edwards with a great new REPUBLICAN Governor! Get out and vote for either @DocAbraham or @EddieRispone (BOTH GREAT)!

Tweet: “Schiff aides worked with Whistleblower.” @foxandfriends @RepLeeZeldin Schiff is a lying mess!

Tweet: The case of Major Mathew Golsteyn is now under review at the White House. Mathew is a highly decorated Green Beret who is being tried for killing a Taliban bombmaker. We train our boys to be killing machines then prosecute them when they kill! @PeteHegseth

Tweet: The deal I just made with China is by far the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country. In fact there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!

Tweet: Louisiana get out and vote REPUBLICAN before going to the big game today. A runoff will be a tremendous win for your Great State - lower taxes and car insurance and better protection of your 2nd Amendment! Fantastic being with you last night!

Tweet: So now they are after the legendary “crime buster” and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!

Tweet: Happy National Farmers Day!

Tweet: That is the real story!

Tweet: Start thinking about getting bigger tractors!

Tweet: The Endless Wars Must End!

Tweet: The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards has done a poor job. NOW HE IS IN A RUNOFF WITH A GREAT REPUBLICAN @EddieRispone. Thank you Louisiana! 66% down to 47% after I explained what a bad job the Governor was doing.

Tweet: The same people that got us into the Middle East Quicksand 8 Trillion Dollars and many thousands of lives (and millions of lives when you count the other side) are now fighting to keep us there. Don’t listen to people that haven’t got a clue. They have proven to be inept!

Tweet: Congratulations to the Great State of Louisiana. A big night. You will soon have a new and wonderful Governor @EddieRispone. Your Taxes and Car Insurance Payments will go DOWN!

Tweet: A despicable human being!

Tweet: The Media is not talking about the big Republican victory last night in Louisiana where a sitting Democrat Governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50%. Big upset! Now @EddieRispone who will be a great Governor will win!

Tweet: Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?

Tweet: Dealing with @LindseyGrahamSC and many members of Congress including Democrats about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey. Treasury is ready to go additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!

Tweet: We have become a far greater Economic Power than ever before and we are using that power for WORLD PEACE!

Tweet: Happy Birthday @USNavy!

Tweet: The Democrats are going to lose a lot of House Seats because of their Fraudulent use of Impeachment. Schiff fabricated phone call a crime. Democrat Senate Seats will also be put at risk even some that were supposedly safe. Look at Louisiana last night North Carolina last week!

Tweet: CHINA HAS ALREADY BEGUN AGRICULTURAL PURCHASES FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS &amp; RANCHERS!

Tweet: .@marklevinshow on @FoxNews is doing a big show tonight on the Democrat’s Impeachment Scam. 10:00 P.M. No guests just Mark. He is angry (like so many others!). At 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews Steve Hilton is looking into the Crooked Bidens. Where’s Hunter?

Tweet: The U.S. has the worst of the ISIS prisoners. Turkey and the Kurds must not let them escape. Europe should have taken them back after numerous requests. They should do it now. They will never come to or be allowed in the United States!

Tweet: Somebody please explain to Chris Wallace of Fox who will never be his father (and my friend) Mike Wallace that the Phone Conversation I had with the President of Ukraine was a congenial &amp; good one. It was only Schiff’s made up version of that conversation that was bad!

Tweet: “Serial killers get more Due Process than the Democrats give to the President of the United States.” @marklevinshow

Tweet: “The Democrats are trashing this President &amp; in the process trashing the U.S. Constitution. Frankly the American People need to wake up to the reality that the Democrats are so drunk on power that they’re willing to destroy this Constitutional Republic.” @GrahamLedger @OANN

Tweet: Former Democrat Senator Harry Reid just stated that Donald Trump is very smart much more popular than people think is underestimated and will be hard to beat in the 2020 Election. Thank you Harry I agree!

Tweet: The same people who got us into the Middle East mess are the people who most want to stay there!

Tweet: Happy Columbus Day!

Tweet: Vote for good guy @seanspicer tonight on Dancing With The Stars. He has always been there for us!

Tweet: Will be looking into the Scott Hapgood case and the Island of Anguilla. Something looks and sounds very wrong. I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved! @foxandfriends @SteveDucey @ainsleyearhardt

Tweet: Wow! Hunter Biden is being forced to leave a Chinese Company. Now watch the Fake News wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him. Only softball questions of him please!

Tweet: America First!

Tweet: Great new book "Resistance (At All Costs): How Trump Haters Are Breaking America" out by Kimberley Strassel of the Wall Street Journal. Kim has treated us fairly and for that I am very appreciative. Check it out today it is great!

Tweet: Statement from President Donald J. Trump Regarding Turkey’s Actions in Northeast Syria

Tweet: The Democrat Party has hijacked the House of Representatives... @MarkLevinShow

Tweet: It doesn't speak for the FULL HOUSE because the FULL HOUSE hasn't spoken. The Democrat Party is pushing this Impeachment. This is a Democrat Party Impeachment as I have been saying a silent COUP effort. @MarkLevinShow

Tweet: The House gone rogue! I want to remind you a little bit about the ring leader in this whole rogue operation against the President of the United States... @MarkLevinShow

Tweet: Shifty Schiff now seems to think they don’t need the Whistleblower who started the whole Scam. The reason is that the Whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the Transcrpt. Also the second Whistleblower is no longer even mentioned!

Tweet: Shifty Schiff now seems to think they don’t need the Whistleblower who started the whole Scam. The reason is that the Whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the Transcript. Also the second Whistleblower is no longer even mentioned!

Tweet: A big scandal at @ABC News. They got caught using really gruesome FAKE footage of the Turks bombing in Syria. A real disgrace. Tomorrow they will ask softball questions to Sleepy Joe Biden’s son Hunter like why did Ukraine &amp; China pay you millions when you knew nothing? Payoff?

Tweet: “Project Veritas-Obtained Undercover Videos Highlight Jeff Zucker’s (@CNN) Campaign To Destroy Trump. Videos Reveal @CNN’s BIAS!” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good or even great lawsuit?

Tweet: Democrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings. If Republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the Fake News. Let the facts come out from the charade of people most of whom I do not know they are interviewing for 9 hours each not selective leaks.

Tweet: Hunter Biden was really bad on @GMA. Now Sleepy Joe has real problems! Reminds me of Crooked Hillary and her 33000 deleted Emails not recoverable!

Tweet: Governor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky! He continues to protect your very important Second Amendment. Matt is Strong on Crime and the Border he Loves our Great Vets and Military. Matt has my Complete and Total Endorsement and always has!

Tweet: Just out: MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS AT THE HIGHEST POINT EVER EVER EVER! How about saying it this way IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! Also MORE PEOPLE WORKING TODAY IN THE USA THAN AT ANY TIME IN HISTORY! Tough numbers for the Radical Left Democrats to beat! Impeach the Pres.

Tweet: Join me in Dallas Texas this Thursday (October 17th) at the American Airlines Center! #KAG2020Tickets:

Tweet: Now that we have found out that @CNN is a virtual fraud rumor has it that Jeff Zucker will be resigining momentarily?

Tweet: Congratulations @StLouisBlues!

Tweet: The @StLouisBlues amazing comeback reminds us to never give up – and never lose faith. When you work hard support each other believe in yourself and give it everything you’ve got victory is always within reach! #STLBlues

Tweet: Looks good to me!

Tweet: A great group of Champions!

Tweet: We now have the greatest Economy in history!

Tweet: You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States. Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal &amp; absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!

Tweet: “What is happening to President Trump with Impeachment is a Constitutional Travesty.” @GrahamLedger The likes of which we have never seen before. It is Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi who should be impeached for fraud!

Tweet: 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! Just won two Congressional Seats in North Carolina &amp; a Governors runoff in Louisiana which Republicans should now win! Because of Impeachment Fraud we will easily take back the House add in the Senate &amp; again win Pres!

Tweet: Our record Economy would CRASH just like in 1929 if any of those clowns became President!

Tweet: Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt. No lawyers no questions no transparency! The good news is that the Radical Left Dems have No Case. It is all based on their Fraud and Fabrication!

Tweet: Senator Rand Paul just wrote a great book “The Case Against Socialism” which is now out. Highly recommended – as America was founded on LIBERTY &amp; INDEPENDENCE – not government coercion domination &amp; control. We were born free and will stay free as long as I am your President!

Tweet: Guatemala Honduras &amp; El Salvador have all signed historic Asylum Cooperation Agreements and are working to end the scourge of human smuggling. To further accelerate this progress the U.S. will shortly be approving targeted assistance in the areas of law enforcement &amp; security.

Tweet: THANK YOU WORKING HARD!

Tweet: FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: I’m fighting for the American people but the Democrats’ sole focus is fighting against ME with their fraudulent Witch Hunt. Go to and tell Democrats in Congress that Enough is Enough!

Tweet: Do you think they like me?

Tweet: Nervous Nancy's unhinged meltdown!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats Pelosi and Schumer stormed out of the Cabinet Room!

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her “upstairs” or she just plain doesn’t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her she is a very sick person!

Tweet: “This President is the most patriotic President I’ve seen in many years. He is going to do what is good for Americans.” Congressman Brian Babin Texas. Thank you Brian!

Tweet: Years of BAD GOVERNMENT such a sorry thing to see!

Tweet: Hope all House Republicans and honest House Democrats will vote to CENSURE Rep. Adam Schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating (making up) a totally phony conversation with the Ukraine President and U.S. President me. Most have never seen such a thing!

Tweet: “About 500000 human beings were killed in Syria while Barack Obama was president &amp; leading for a “political settlement” to that civil war. Media has been more outraged in the last 72 hours over our Syria policy than they were at any point during 7 years of slaughter.” BuckSexton

Tweet: I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops &amp; bring them home from the ridiculous &amp; costly Endless Wars and be scorned. Democrats always liked that position until I took it. Democrats always liked Walls until I built them. Do you see what’s happening here?

Tweet: This is the real story. Thank you Jim!

Tweet: My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see first hand the strength passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard if not impossible to replace!

Tweet: The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History!

Tweet: As the Witch Hunt continues!

Tweet: This number based on the Economy &amp; how well our Country is doing would potentially be 75% if not for the Fake News &amp; Phony Witch Hunt. 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party!

Tweet: Great news out of Turkey. News Conference shortly with @VP and @SecPompeo. Thank you to @RTErdogan. Millions of lives will be saved!

Tweet: This deal could NEVER have been made 3 days ago. There needed to be some “tough” love in order to get it done. Great for everybody. Proud of all!

Tweet: This is a great day for civilization. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary but somewhat unconventional path. People have been trying to make this “Deal” for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!

Tweet: See you soon Dallas Texas!

Tweet: Just arrived at the American Airlines Center in Dallas Texas. Will be out shortly as we wait for more of you to get in! #TRUMP2020

Tweet: Thank you Dallas Texas - I love you! #TrumpRallyDallas #KAG2020

Tweet: The radical left tolerates no dissent it permits no opposition it accepts no compromise and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the American People. They are coming after me because I am fighting for YOU! #TrumpRallyDallas #KAG2020

Tweet: Tonight we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the Democrat Party the Fake News Media and the rogue bureaucrats of the Deep State. The only message these radicals will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3 2020! #KAG2020

Tweet: Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American Worker the American Family and the American Dream! #KAG2020

Tweet: The USA!

Tweet: DEFEAT TERRORISM!

Tweet: Can you believe I am doing this important work for our Country and have to deal with Corrupt Adam Schiff and the Do Nothing Democrats at the same time? It was not intended to be this way for a President!

Tweet: Think of how many lives we saved in Syria and Turkey by getting a ceasefire yesterday. Thousands and thousands and maybe many more!

Tweet: REPUBLICANS MUST STICK TOGETHER AND FIGHT!

Tweet: Corrupt Congressman Adam Schiff is angry that Ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent Witch Hunt are turning out to be good for me - some really good! He’s got all meetings locked down no transparency only his illegal leaks. A very dishonest sleazebag!

Tweet: “Because the House has already voted against the Impeachment Proceeding the current inquiry is totally invalid. The current sham of a so-called investigation is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab. It needs to end.” @JasonChaffetz @seanhannity Corrupt Adam Schiff

Tweet: Congressman Michael McCaul “Schiff’s inquiry defies Democracy.” @FoxNews @seanhannity

Tweet: Pelosi and Impeachment - There have already been 3 Votes and they’ve all failed miserably. Here’s why there may not be a fourth - 137 Democrats voted against on the last vote.” @JasonChaffetz @seanhannity Many of those voting in favor will be beaten in 2020!

Tweet: Susan Rice who was a disaster to President Obama as National Security Advisor is now telling us her opinion on what to do in Syria. Remember RED LINE IN THE SAND? That was Obama. Millions killed! No thanks Susan you were a disaster.

Tweet: #StopTheCoup

Tweet: Such a disgrace that the Do Nothing Democrats are doing just as their name suggests Doing Nothing! USMCA anyone?

Tweet: There has never been a greater fraud on Congress. Shifty Schiff is Corrupt. Go Andy!

Tweet: Texas is great!

Tweet: I agree!

Tweet: Thank you very much. Working hard!

Tweet: “I don’t see anything that constitutes an Impeachable offense - Nothing here rises to the level of Impeachment. The Democrats are making a mistake with this secrecy.” Kenn Starr former Special Prosecutor

Tweet: A Great Book by Kimberley Strassel!

Tweet: .@RepMcClintock Thank you Tom. Great interview on @TeamCavuto! @FoxNews

Tweet: Just another FAKE SUPPRESSION POLL this time from @FoxNews of course!

Tweet: It is ONLY about this!

Tweet: Crooked Hillary Clinton just called the respected environmentalist and Green Party candidate Jill Stein a “Russian Asset.” They need a Green Party more than ever after looking at the Democrats disastrous environmental program!

Tweet: See you there!

Tweet: “The President never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. The only reason we were holding the money was because of concern about LACK OF SUPPORT FROM OTHER NATIONS and CONCERNS OVER CORRUPTION.” Yesterday’s Mick Mulvaney statement

Tweet: Never give up. We are doing GREAT! We are WINNING!

Tweet: So now Crooked Hillary is at it again! She is calling Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard “a Russian favorite” and Jill Stein “a Russian asset.” As you may have heard I was called a big Russia lover also (actually I do like Russian people. I like all people!). Hillary’s gone Crazy!

Tweet: The WALL is making a very big difference. Even Dems in area are happy!

Tweet: Mark Esperanto Secretary of Defense “The ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with the Kurds.” USA soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones. We have secured the Oil. Bringing soldiers home!

Tweet: “The ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with Kurds. U.S. soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone. We have secured the Oil.” Mark Esper Secretary of Defense. Ending endless wars!

Tweet: Pelosi is now leading a delegation of 9 including Corrupt Adam Schiff to Jordan to check out Syria. She should find out why Obama drew The Red Line In the Sand &amp; then did NOTHING losing Syria &amp; all respect. I did something 58 missiles. One million died under Obama’s mistake!

Tweet: So interesting that when I announced Trump National Doral in Miami would be used for the hosting of the G-7 and then rescinded due to Do Nothing Democrat/Fake News Anger very few in Media mentioned that NO PROFITS would be taken or would be given FREE if legally permissible!

Tweet: “To the Democrats Impeachment is partisan politics dressed up as principle.” @SteveHiltonx @FoxNews

Tweet: Congratulations Barbara!

Tweet: Adam Schiff is a Corrupt Politician!

Tweet: A Great Democrat Scam!

Tweet: Thank you John so nice!

Tweet: Great new book by wonderful and very street smart author Dan Bongino EXONERATED THE FAILED TAKEDOWN OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BY THE SWAMP. Dan hits all of the crooked points of the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Nevertheless the Scam continues!

Tweet: Censure (at least) Corrupt Adam Schiff! After what he got caught doing any pol who does not so vote cannot be honest....are you listening Dems?

Tweet: Doral in Miami would have been the best place to hold the G-7 and free but too much heat from the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats &amp; their Partner the Fake News Media! I’m surprised that they allow me to give up my $400000 Plus Presidential Salary! We’ll find someplace else!

Tweet: Will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Enjoy!

Tweet: Thank you Dan and Kevin. Great Vote!

Tweet: Thank you Liz. Shows great Republican support!

Tweet: Congratulations to @JustinTrudeau on a wonderful and hard fought victory. Canada is well served. I look forward to working with you toward the betterment of both of our countries!

Tweet: “The Ambassador to the European Union has already testified he said there was no quid pro quo. He said the President had told him that.” @kilmeade @foxandfriends

Tweet: “I thought a very revealing poll was done by The New York Times. By about a 10 point margin those in battleground states polled are against impeaching the President and if Nancy Pelosi doesn’t take note of that maybe she is the third rate politician.” @kilmeade @foxandfriends

Tweet: So some day if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House even by a tiny margin they can impeach the President without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!

Tweet: Thank you Republicans. 185 out of 185 present voted for “US” last night. Really good!

Tweet: 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!

Tweet: Can’t believe that Nervous Nancy Pelosi isn’t moving faster on USMCA. Her people want it they don’t know why she isn’t putting it up for a bipartisan vote. Taking too long!

Tweet: “The Democrats are trying to draw out this inquiry because they don’t have the support. Donald Trump is guilty only of winning the 2016 Election.” @MZHemingway @foxandfriends

Tweet: Great Job Tim!

Tweet: Good news seems to be happening with respect to Turkey Syria and the Middle East. Further reports to come later!

Tweet: Wrong never even discussed this with Kellyanne Conway ot Steve Mnuchin. Just more Fake News!

Tweet: Wrong never even discussed this with Kellyanne Conway or Steve Mnuchin. Just more Fake News!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Dems have nothing but time!

Tweet: The Witch Hunt continues!

Tweet: The Democrats Scam goes on and on! They Do Nothing!

Tweet: Thank you Steve!

Tweet: It never ends. The Do Nothing Dems are terrible!

Tweet: Neither he (Taylor) or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can’t have a quid pro quo with no quo.” Congressman John Ratcliffe @foxandfriends Where is the Whistleblower? The Do Nothing Dems case is DEAD!

Tweet: Republicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the House because of what the Do Nothing Democrats have done to our Country!

Tweet: Big success on the Turkey/Syria Border. Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured. I will be making a statement at 11:00 A.M. from the White House. Thank you!

Tweet: Where’s the Whistleblower?

Tweet: Thank you General Mazloum for your kind words and courage. Please extend my warmest regards to the Kurdish people. I look forward to seeing you soon. @mustefabali

Tweet: The Never Trumper Republicans though on respirators with not many left are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them they are human scum!

Tweet: It would be really great if the people within the Trump Administration all well-meaning and good (I hope!) could stop hiring Never Trumpers who are worse than the Do Nothing Democrats. Nothing good will ever come from them!

Tweet: It was wonderful to be back in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania with the incredible Patriots who fuel our factories light up our homes power our industries and fill our hearts with true American Pride! #SHALEINSIGHT2019

Tweet: PROMISES MADE PROMISES KEPT! #SHALEINSIGHT2019

Tweet: (Kiddingly) We’re building a Wall in Colorado”(then stated “we’re not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we’re building on the Border”) refered to people in the very packed auditorium from Colorado &amp; Kansas getting the benefit of the Border Wall!

Tweet: Just a continuation of the Witch Hunt!

Tweet: It is the only thing the Do Nothing Dems are doing!

Tweet: Don’t hurt them please!

Tweet: The Federal Reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesn’t lower the Rate and even ideally stimulate. Take a look around the World at our competitors. Germany and others are actually GETTING PAID to borrow money. Fed was way too fast to raise and way too slow to cut!

Tweet: Thank you to House Republicans for being tough smart and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History. It has been going on since long before I even got Elected (the Insurance Policy!). A total Scam!

Tweet: The Oil Fields discussed in my speech on Turkey/Kurds yesterday were held by ISIS until the United States took them over with the help of the Kurds. We will NEVER let a reconstituted ISIS have those fields!

Tweet: I really enjoyed my conversation with General @MazloumAbdi. He appreciates what we have done and I appreciate what the Kurds have done. Perhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region!

Tweet: Where is the Whistleblower and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian President? Why did the IG allow this to happen? Who is the so-called Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!

Tweet: Another big dropout of the Presidential race was along with 0% Tim Ryan 0% @RepSwalwell. Such talk and bravado from both and nothing to show. They stood for nothing and the voters couldn’t stand by them. Obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end!

Tweet: So Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio has finally dropped out of the race for President registering ZERO in the polls &amp; unable to even qualify for the debate stage. See Tim it’s not so easy out there if you don’t know what you’re doing. He wasn’t effective for USA workers just talk!

Tweet: “Donald J. Trump is an absolutely historic President already in less than 3 years in office. His record is there for everyone to look at &amp; to examine and compare. This is an illegitimate effort to overthrow a President not a formal Impeachment inquiry.” @LouDobbs Thank you Lou

Tweet: Heading to South Carolina!

Tweet: Thank you @robertjeffress!

Tweet: It was my great honor to deliver the keynote address at the 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum hosted by the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center in South Carolina and my true honor to receive the Bipartisan Justice Award thank you!

Tweet: To Tim: The Button on the IPhone was FAR better than the Swipe!

Tweet: Had a beautiful dinner last night at Camp David in celebration of the 10th Wedding Anniversary of Ivanka and Jared. Attended by a small number of family and friends it could not have been nicer. Camp David is a special place. Cost of the event will be totally paid for by me!

Tweet: “Not a single American citizen has been charged with anything related to Russian Collusion not one person.” @TuckerCarlson It was all an illegal Witch Hunt!

Tweet: The Ukraine investigation is just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it. Even Shifty Schiff got caught cheating when he made up what I said on the call!

Tweet: My Administration is fighting hard to end the Opioid Crisis. Join with us by disposing unused or expired prescription medications at over 4000 locations across this great Country. Find a location TODAY from 10am-2pm at #TakeBackDay

Tweet: The Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories with zero sources that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong. It is the other side including Schiff and his made up story that are concerned. Witch Hunt continues!

Tweet: Where’s the Whistleblower?

Tweet: Something very big has just happened!

Tweet: As Diwali commences @FLOTUS Melania and I wish those observing the Festival of Lights a blessed and happy celebration! #HappyDiwali

Tweet: Thank you to @MarthaRaddatz and @TerryMoran for a job well done!

Tweet: The S&amp;P just hit an ALL TIME HIGH. This is a big win for jobs 401-K’s and frankly EVERYONE! Our Country is doing great. Even killed long sought ISIS murderer Al-Baghdadi. We are stronger than ever before with GREAT upward potential. Enjoy!

Tweet: THANK YOU #IACP2019!

Tweet: An AMAZING CHAMPION. Great going Tiger! @TigerWoods

Tweet: We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi!

Tweet: So nice thank you!

Tweet: Can you believe that Shifty Adam Schiff the biggest leaker in D.C. and a corrupt politician is upset that we didn’t inform him before we raided and killed the #1 terrorist in the WORLD!? Wouldn’t be surprised if the Do Nothing Democrats Impeach me over that! DRAIN THE SWAMP!!

Tweet: “Americans know by now that the Impeachment inquiry is just another hoax and silent coup to remove the President from office.” J.J. Crovatto Don’t worry J.J. Schiff is a leaker &amp; corrupt politician who made up what I said on the call in order to hurt the Republican Party &amp; me!

Tweet: “There is no underlying crime in that transcript.” @IngrahamAngle 100% correct and the Whistleblower disappeared after I released the transcript of the call. Where is the Whistleblower? That is why this is now called the Impeachment Hoax! The Do Nothing Dems are Doing Nothing!

Tweet: The only crimes in the Impeachment Hoax were committed by Shifty Adam Schiff when he totally made up my phone conversation with the Ukrainian President and read it to Congress together with numerous others on Shifty’s side. Schiff should be Impeached and worse!

Tweet: “This is a big win for America and also for President Trump.” @nypost

Tweet: Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER! Ukrain said NO PRESSURE.

Tweet: Correct a total scam!

Tweet: A great book by a great guy. Get it now!

Tweet: Where’s the Whistleblower? Just read the Transcript everything else is made up garbage by Shifty Schiff and the Never Trumpers!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the Best Economy Ever the monumental weekend raid Tax Cuts the Rebuilding of our Military etc. The Impeachment Hoax is a disgrace. Read the transcript!

Tweet: How many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT! I knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?) which was fine with me but why so many?

Tweet: Supposedly according to the Corrupt Media the Ukraine call “concerned” today’s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can’t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party a record. Thank you!

Tweet: Just confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot - Now he is also Dead!

Tweet: A great new book just out “The Plot Against the President. The True Story Of How Congressman Devin Nunez Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal In U.S. History.” Shows very bad and corrupt people on the other side. Check it out!

Tweet: Consumer Confidence number very good. Housing sales in September up nicely. Economy Rocks!

Tweet: Nervous Nancy Pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the Republican Party. Our Polls show that it is going to be just the oppidite. The Do Nothing Dems will lose many seats in 2020. They have a Death Wish led by a corrupt politician Adam Schiff!

Tweet: “Over in Europe and Japan they have NEGATIVE RATES. They get paid to borrow money. Don’t we have to follow our competitors?” @Varneyco Yes we do. The Fed doesn’t have a clue! We have unlimited potential only held back by the Federal Reserve. But we are winning anyway!

Tweet: Nervous Nancy Pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the Republican Party. Our Polls show that it is going to be just the opposite. The Do Nothing Dems will lose many seats in 2020. They have a Death Wish led by a corrupt politician Adam Schiff!

Tweet: The Greatest Economy in American History!

Tweet: “It does appear it has to do with Nancy Pelosi retaining her Speakership in the next Congress. She would like that so she’s going to put it to a vote because that’s what her political left really wants.” @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends A disgraceful use of Impeachment. Will backfire!

Tweet: A Federal Judge is allowing the Nick Sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting Washington Post (which is no longer available at the White House!). He could now have a good chance of winning. Go Nick!

Tweet: Yesterday’s Never Trumper witness could find NO Quid Pro Quo in the Transcript of the phone call. There were many people listening to the call. How come they (including the President of Ukraine) found NOTHING wrong with it. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: “Precisely the same program that the Democrats are trying to Impeach President Trump for supposedly slow walking tomorrow right here in the Senate they (the Dems) say they’re going to filibuster for the exact same program.” @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell. Do Nothing Democrats!

Tweet: Thank you @GM @FiatChrysler_NA @Toyota and @GloblAutomkrs for standing with us for Better Cheaper Safer Cars for Americans. California has treated the Auto Industry very poorly for many years harming Workers and Consumers. We are fixing this problem!

Tweet: “Adam Schiff’s drive to impeach Trump based on opinions deception and illusions – Not facts” @GreggJarrett

Tweet: Thank you @GLFOP!

Tweet: The Democrats have been on this path for 3 years. The first headline I saw...before the President was sworn in was that the Impeachment process was beginning...so this is just further evidence that this is what they had in mind from the very beginning. @senatemajldr

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats have gone Crazy. Very bad for USA!

Tweet: Thanks Lee!

Tweet: “It has been 3 years and Donald Trump hasn’t done anything wrong. Donald Trump hasn’t done a single thing of which he has been accused.” @RushLimbaughEIB @seanhannity A Witch Hunt like no other!

Tweet: “This is the biggest most disgusting scandal and it’s all on the Democrat Party that has highjacked the Impeachment process our tax dollars the House of Representatives to push their 2020 Election. That’s what’s going on.” @marklevinshow Cannot be said any better!

Tweet: Stock Market up BIG! Record highs for S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. Enjoy!

Tweet: Republicans have never been more unified than they are right now! The Dems are a mess under the corrupt leadership of Nervous Nancy Pelosi and Shifty Adam Schiff!

Tweet: Oh no Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was “born for this.” I don’t think so!

Tweet: You can’t Impeach someone who hasn’t done anything wrong!

Tweet: The Whistleblower must come forward to explain why his account of the phone call with the Ukrainian President was so inaccurate (fraudulent?). Why did the Whistleblower deal with corrupt politician Shifty Adam Schiff and/or his committee?

Tweet: A great new book by Howie Carr “What Really Happened How Donald J. Trump Saved America From Hillary Clinton” is on sale now. Howie is a talented New England force who was there at the very beginning!

Tweet: Tate Reeves will be a great Governor of Mississippi and what an electric Rally last night. Vote for Tate on Tuesday!

Tweet: Louisiana has a chance to have a really great Governor in @EddieRispone. Auto insurance costs and taxes will be coming way down with Eddie and your 2nd Amendment will be protected. Current Democrat governor has done a really poor job! VOTE EARLY FOR EDDIE!

Tweet: Big Rally in Kentucky on Monday night for a man who has worked really hard &amp; done a GREAT job Governor @MattBevin. Kentucky is having the best economic year ever under Matt’s leadership. He is a fantastic guy who loves our Military our Vets and our 2nd Amendment. Vote Tuesday!

Tweet: The Whistleblower has disappeared. Where is the Whistleblower?

Tweet: Schiff will change the transcripts just like he fraudulently made up the phone call. He is a corrupt politician!

Tweet: A giant Scam!

Tweet: Didn’t he pick the Whistleblower?

Tweet: The Whistleblower got it sooo wrong that HE must come forward. The Fake News Media knows who he is but being an arm of the Democrat Party don’t want to reveal him because there would be hell to pay. Reveal the Whistleblower and end the Impeachment Hoax!

Tweet: Great fight Champ!

Tweet: “Morrison testifies he saw nothing wrong with the Trump call.” @OANN

Tweet: Many people listened to my phone call with the Ukrainian President while it was being made. I never heard any complaints. The reason is that it was totally appropriate I say perfect. Republicans have never been more unified and my Republican Approval Rating is now 95%!

Tweet: The Angry Majority!

Tweet: Fake News!

Tweet: The Democrats are Fixers and they are working overtime to FIX the Impeachment “Process” in order to hurt the Republican Party and me. Nancy Pelosi should instead Fix her broken District and Corrupt Adam should clean up &amp; manage the California forests which are always burning!

Tweet: The Fake News Media is working hard so that information about the Whistleblower’s identity which may be very bad for them and their Democrat partners never reaches the Public.

Tweet: I hope everyone in the Great State of Virginia will get out and VOTE on Tuesday in all of the local and state elections to send a signal to D.C. that you want lower taxes a strong Military Border &amp; 2nd Amendment great healthcare and must take care of our Vets. VOTE REPUBLICAN

Tweet: Virginia has the best Unemployment and Economic numbers in the history of the State. If the Democrats get in those numbers will go rapidly in the other direction. On Tuesday Vote Republican!

Tweet: False stories are being reported that a few Republican Senators are saying that President Trump may have done a quid pro quo but it doesn’t matter there is nothing wrong with that it is not an impeachable event. Perhaps so but read the transcript there is no quid pro quo!

Tweet: Don’t miss this show!

Tweet: We won’t Steve!

Tweet: Good point!

Tweet: @marklevinshow Mark Levin: “We ought to talk about the substance of this phone call. We have the call I don’t know what we need witnesses for? Can’t we read English? Do I need a Whistleblower to tell me what I’m reading? Do I need a Lt. C. to tell me? NO.” So plain and simple!

Tweet: Great Republican Geary Higgins has my complete and total Endorsement for Virginia Senate 13th District. He is strong on Crime the Border our Military Cutting Taxes and protecting your 2nd Amendment. Dem John Bell will take your guns &amp; raise your taxes. Vote for Geary Higgins

Tweet: Louisiana get out and Vote Early for @EddieRispone as your next Governor. Lower Taxes and car insurance. Will protect your 2nd Amendment. John Bel Edwards is always fighting our MAGA Agenda. Wants to raise your taxes and car insurance to the sky. Vote for Republican Eddie R!

Tweet: Great! But how do you know it was a “mistweet?” May be something with deep meaning!

Tweet: Mark Levin a great lawyer and scholar said last night on his @marklevinshow that all you have to do is read the transcript of the call you do not need Never Trumpers or other witnesses to say what it means or says. It is plainly and very well stated for all to see. Witch Hunt

Tweet: What I said on the phone call with the Ukrainian President is “perfectly” stated. There is no reason to call witnesses to analyze my words and meaning. This is just another Democrat Hoax that I have had to live with from the day I got elected (and before!). Disgraceful!

Tweet: The Whistleblower gave false information &amp; dealt with corrupt politician Schiff. He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!

Tweet: 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!

Tweet: “There is no Whistleblower. There is someone with an agenda against Donald Trump. What he was blowing the whistle on didn’t happen. We have the transcript of the call. This is all a farce and no Republican should forget that.” @dbongino @foxandfriends

Tweet: Stock Market hits RECORD HIGH. Spend your money well!

Tweet: “The Impeachment Hoax has fired up voters in Kentucky Mississippi and Louisiana.” @foxandfriends

Tweet: This is the time for Mexico with the help of the United States to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth. We merely await a call from your great new president!

Tweet: So sad to see what is happening in New York where Governor Cuomo and Mayor DeBlasio are letting out 900 Criminals some hardened and bad onto the sidewalks of our rapidly declining because of them city. The Radical Left Dems are killing our cities. NYPD Chief is resigning!

Tweet: Congratulations to @tatereeves on winning Governor of the Great State of Mississippi. Our big Rally on Friday night moved the numbers from a tie to a big WIN. Great reaction under pressure Tate!

Tweet: A lot of winning in Kentucky. Check out the numbers.

Tweet: Our big Kentucky Rally on Monday night had a massive impact on all of the races. The increase in Governors race was at least 15 points and maybe 20! Will be in Louisiana for @EddieRispone on Wednesday night. Big Rally!

Tweet: Great going Tate!

Tweet: Based on the Kentucky results Mitch McConnell @senatemajldr will win BIG in Kentucky next year!

Tweet: “Based on the things I’ve seen the Democrats have no case or a weak case at best. I don’t think there are or will be well founded articles of Impeachment here.” Robert Wray respected former prosecutor. It is a phony scam by the Do Nothing Dems! @foxandfriends

Tweet: Thank you to Kurt Volker U.S. Envoy to Ukraine who said in his Congressional Testimony just released “You asked what conversations did I have about that quid pro quo et cetra. NONE because I didn’t know there was a quid pro quo.” Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Stock Markets (all three) hit another ALL TIME &amp; HISTORIC HIGH yesterday! You are sooo lucky to have me as your President (just kidding!). Spend your money well!

Tweet: Just had a meeting with top representatives from Egypt Ethiopia and Sudan to help solve their long running dispute on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam one of the largest in the world currently being built. The meeting went well and discussions will continue during the day!

Tweet: Just had a very good call with President @RTErdogan of Turkey. He informed me that they have captured numerous ISIS fighters that were reported to have escaped during the conflict – including a wife and sister of terrorist killer al Baghdadi….

Tweet: Thanks to many of you here today my Administration and Republicans in Congress have now confirmed 157 FEDERAL JUDGES who will uphold our Constitution AS WRITTEN a profoundly historic milestone and a truly momentous achievement!

Tweet: LOUISIANA! Early voting is underway until Saturday it’s time to get out and VOTE to REPLACE Radical Liberal Democrat John Bel Edwards with a great new REPUBLICAN Governor @EddieRispone! #GeauxVotePOLL FINDER:

Tweet: Years ago when Media was legitimate people known as “Fact Checkers” would always call to check and see if a story was accurate. Nowadays they don’t use “Fact Checkers” anymore they just write whatever they want!

Tweet: Just returned to the @WhiteHouse after a great evening in Monroe Louisiana with a massive turnout of Great American Patriots. With early voting underway until Sat find your polling location below &amp; go vote for your next #LAgov @EddieRispone!

Tweet: Bill Barr did not decline my request to talk about Ukraine. The story was a Fake Washington Post con job with an “anonymous” source that doesn’t exist. Just read the Transcript. The Justice Department already ruled that the call was good. We don’t have freedom of the press!

Tweet: The degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story about me asking Bill Barr to hold a news conference. Never happened and there were no sources!

Tweet: Read the Transcript!

Tweet: Based on the information released last night about the Fake Whistleblowers attorney the Impeachment Hoax should be ended IMMEDIATELY! There is no case except against the other side!

Tweet: “What did Hunter Biden do for the money?” @SenJohnKennedy A very good question. He and Sleepy Joe must testify!

Tweet: It was just explained to me that for next weeks Fake Hearing (trial) in the House as they interview Never Trumpers and others I get NO LAWYER &amp; NO DUE PROCESS. It is a Pelosi Schiff Scam against the Republican Party and me. This Witch Hunt should not be allowed to proceed!

Tweet: THANK YOU! #MAGA

Tweet: The Amazon Washington Post and three lowlife reporters Matt Zapotosky Josh Dawsey and Carol Leonnig wrote another Fake News story without any sources (pure fiction) about Bill Barr &amp; myself. We both deny this story which they knew before they wrote it. A garbage newspaper!

Tweet: The Radical Left Dems and LameStream Media are just trying to make it hard for Republicans and me to win in 2020. The new Impeachment Hoax is already turning against them!

Tweet: Stock Market up big today. A New Record. Enjoy!

Tweet: STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP

Tweet: I will be announcing the winners of the #MAGACHALLENGE and inviting them to the @WhiteHouse to meet with me and perform. Good luck!

Tweet: “Mark Levin blasts Adam Schiff claims 'the law is on the president's side' on Ukraine”

Tweet: Fake News is reporting that I am talking to Mark Burnett about doing a big show perhaps The Apprentice after the presidency which I would assume they mean in 5 years. This is not true never had such a conversation don’t even have time to think about it. False reporting!

Tweet: Good luck Vince this will be great!

Tweet: True!

Tweet: We will win big!

Tweet: Just finished reading my son Donald’s just out new book “Triggered.” It is really good! He along with many of us was very unfairly treated. But we all fight back and we always win!

Tweet: Bringing the word “Nationalism” back into the mainstream - great job by Rich Lowry! Very important book.

Tweet: But the Witch Hunt continues. After 3 years of relentless attacks against the Republican Party &amp; me the Do Nothing Dems are losers for America!

Tweet: PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!

Tweet: I recommend that Nervous Nancy Pelosi (who backed up Schiff’s lie) Shifty Adam Schiff Sleepy Joe Biden the Whistleblower (who miraculously disappeared after I released the transcript of the call) the 2nd Whistleblower (who also disappeared) &amp; the I.G. be part of the list!

Tweet: 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! #MAGA #KAG2020

Tweet: Thank you Lee and David!

Tweet: A terrible lie. How can she do such a thing?

Tweet: Thank you to LSU and Alabama for a great game!

Tweet: Thank you Terrence!

Tweet: Thank you Andrew. Meadow was watching and is so proud of her great father and family!

Tweet: Great!

Tweet: Such GREAT people!

Tweet: “He is not a Whistleblower. He is a deepstater. Let the President do the job he was elected to do.” @JudgeJeanine

Tweet: Such an amazing game &amp; place!

Tweet: Make America Great Again!

Tweet: ABC is as bad as the rest of them. Journalistic standards are nonexistent today. The press is so dishonest that we no longer have Freedom of the Press!

Tweet: Corrupt politician Adam Schiff wants people from the White House to testify in his and Pelosi’s disgraceful Witch Hunt yet he will not allow a White House lawyer nor will he allow ANY of our requested witnesses. This is a first in due process and Congressional history!

Tweet: “There’s nothing there! I’m trying to let the House know that they’re dividing America for no good reason. We’ve got a lot of things we should be doing like lowering drug costs &amp; getting a trade deal with Mexico and Canada.” @LindseyGrahamSC The Do Nothing Dems have gone crazy!

Tweet: The call to the Ukrainian President was PERFECT. Read the Transcript! There was NOTHING said that was in any way wrong. Republicans don’t be led into the fools trap of saying it was not perfect but is not impeachable. No it is much stronger than that. NOTHING WAS DONE WRONG!

Tweet: .@NikkiHaley is out with a new book “With All Due Respect” this week. Make sure you order your copy today or stop by one of her book tour stops to get a copy and say hello. Good luck Nikki!

Tweet: If Iran is able to turn over to the U.S. kidnapped former FBI Agent Robert A. Levinson who has been missing in Iran for 12 years it would be a very positive step. At the same time upon information &amp; belief Iran is &amp; has been enriching uranium. THAT WOULD BE A VERY BAD STEP!

Tweet: A great new book just out “The Plot Against the President. The True Story Of How Congressman Devin Nunes Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal In U.S. History.” Shows very bad and corrupt people on the other side. Check it out!

Tweet: HAPPY VETERANS DAY!

Tweet: Will be meeting with representatives of the Vaping industry together with medical professionals and individual state representatives to come up with an acceptable solution to the Vaping and E-cigarette dilemma. Children’s health &amp; safety together with jobs will be a focus!

Tweet: So with one Rally by me at the end of the campaign I lift the poll numbers of Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin by 19 points he just misses every other Republican in the Commonwealth wins big and the Fake News blames me for a bad night! OK! By the way Mississippi won everything!

Tweet: The lawyer for the Whistleblower takes away all credibility from this big Impeachment Scam! It should be ended and the Whistleblower his lawyer and Corrupt politician Schiff should be investigared for fraud!

Tweet: Shifty Adam Schiff will only release doctored transcripts. We haven’t even seen the documents and are restricted from (get this) having a lawyer. Republicans should put out their own transcripts! Schiff must testify as to why he MADE UP a statement from me and read it to all!

Tweet: “The Chinese say (about Trump’s Trade War &amp; Tariffs) ‘he brought us to the table.’ This is the most prosperous economy the world has ever seen and it’s going to be a very prosperous economy.” Jamie Dimon on @60Minutes Thank you President Trump &amp; the Republican Party!

Tweet: Today we come together as one Nation to salute the Veterans of the United States Armed Forces – the greatest warriors ever to walk on the face of the Earth. Our Veterans risked everything for us. Now it is our duty to serve and protect THEM every day of our lives!

Tweet: Where is the Whistleblower who gave so much false information? Must testify along with Schiff and others!

Tweet: To think I signed the Whistleblower Protection Act!

Tweet: Read the Transcript. It is PERFECT!

Tweet: Schiff is giving Republicans NO WITNESSES NO LAWYER &amp; NO DUE PROCESS! It is a totally one sided Witch Hunt. This can’t be making the Democrats look good. Such a farce!

Tweet: Just like Schiff fabricated my phone call he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing!

Tweet: In order to continue being the most Transparent President in history I will be releasing sometime this week the Transcript of the first and therefore most important phone call I had with the President of Ukraine. I am sure you will find it tantalizing!

Tweet: Schiff and the Dems have created this whole thing they reverse engineer it. They’ve been vowing to impeach for three years. Why should we listen to them? Why should we want to?” @greggutfeld @FoxNews

Tweet: “This isn’t about Ukraine. This isn’t about Impeachment. This is about subverting Democracy!” @BillOReilly So true and led by angry and dishonest people who hate themselves and must hate our Country!

Tweet: Vote for Sean Spicer on Dancing with the Stars. He is a great and very loyal guy who is working very hard. He is in the quarterfinals - all the way with Sean! #MAGA #KAG

Tweet: A great try by @seanspicer. We are all proud of you!

Tweet: I will be releasing the transcript of the first and therefore more important phone call with the Ukrainian President before week’s end!

Tweet: Economy is BOOMING. Seems set to have yet another record day!

Tweet: Many of the people in DACA no longer very young are far from “angels.” Some are very tough hardened criminals. President Obama said he had no legal right to sign order but would anyway. If Supreme Court remedies with overturn a deal will be made with Dems for them to stay!

Tweet: A total Impeachment Scam by the Do Nothing Democrats!

Tweet: DACA recipients with arrest records: 53792! That is a very large proportion of the total. @LouDobbs Not good but we will be able to make a deal with the Dems!

Tweet: “This ridiculous Impeachment is a travesty it’s not an inquiry. Just read the transcript.” @LouDobbs

Tweet: “Millions of Americans will see what a partisan sham this whole thing is.” Rush Limbaugh @foxandfriends Also why is corrupt politician Schiff allowed to hand over cross examination to a high priced outside lawyer. Did that lawyer ever work for me which would be a conflict?

Tweet: The Democrats have stacked the deck against President Trump and the Republicans. They have leaked out everything. @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends

Tweet: NEVER TRUMPERS!

Tweet: READ THE TRANSCRIPT!

Tweet: Thank you @FranklinGraham. It is a time of “shame” for our Country. The Democrats know what they are doing is wrong!

Tweet: Wow! Was just told that my son’s book “Triggered” is Number One on The New York Times Bestseller List. Congratulations Don!

Tweet: .@RepRatcliffe asked the two “star” witnesses “where is the impeachable event in that call?” Both stared straight ahead with a blank look on their face remained silent &amp; were unable to answer the question. That would be the end of a case run by normal people! - but not Shifty!

Tweet: Hit New Stock Market record again yesterday the 20th time this year with GREAT potential for the future. USA is where the action is. Companies and jobs are coming back like never before!

Tweet: Walmart announces great numbers. No impact from Tariffs (which are contributing $Billions to our Treasury). Inflation low (do you hear that Powell?)!

Tweet: “Neither one of the Democrat star witnesses at the Impeachment hearings could point out an impeachable offense. That’s the result!” @Varneyco @FoxBusiness

Tweet: “That hearing was about a policy dispute.” Robert Ray. “Regular people watching this cannot conclude that the President of the United States can be impeached.” @Varneyco

Tweet: Where’s the Fake Whistleblower?

Tweet: Getting ready to land in Louisiana to do Rally with Great Republican @EddieRispone for Governor. He will get your taxes and auto insurance (highest in Country!) way down. Loves our Military &amp; Vets. Will protect your 2nd Amendment. VOTE SATURDAY!

Tweet: This Saturday the eyes of history are looking at the people of Louisiana. If you want to defend your values your jobs and your freedom then you need to REPLACE Radical Liberal John Bel Edwards with a true Louisiana Patriot: @EddieRispone! #GeauxVote

Tweet: Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.

Tweet: Another Record Stock Market 21 times this year despite an ongoing &amp; totally unfounded Witch Hunt &amp; a Democrat Party that would love to see a nice big juicy recession. In actuality the potential for the United States is unlimited. We will power through the Do Nothing Dems!

Tweet: We have vacancies in various departments because we do not want or need as many people as past administrations (and save great cost) and also the Democrats delay the approval process to levels unprecedented in the history of our Country!

Tweet: Stock Market up big. New and Historic Record. Job jobs jobs!

Tweet: THANK YOU! #MAGA #KAG

Tweet: LOUISIANA VOTE @EddieRispone TODAY! He will be a great governor!

Tweet: Dow hits 28000 - FIRST TIME EVER HIGHEST EVER! Gee Pelosi &amp; Schitt have a good idea “lets Impeach the President.” If something like that ever happened it would lead to the biggest FALL in Market History. It’s called a Depression not a Recession! So much for 401-K’s &amp; Jobs!

Tweet: “Triggered” a great book by my son Don. Now number one on @NYTIMES LIST. Keep it there for a while!

Tweet: “I mean come on. The Democrats are doing focus groups to try and figure out what words to use to move the needle. The Democrats know this is political and they’re just trying to drag Trump’s name into the mud!” Lisa Booth @foxandfriends Thank you Lisa!

Tweet: A new Republican Star is born. Great going @EliseStefanik!

Tweet: Dowd never understood the pulse of the Republican Party present or past. He’s just a 3rd rate hit job for Fake News @ABC!

Tweet: Mr. Chairman Joe Biden may be Sleepy and Very Slow but he is not a “rabid dog.” He is actually somewhat better than that but I am the only one who can get you where you have to be. You should act quickly get the deal done. See you soon!

Tweet: .@MariaBartiromo has a GREAT show going on right now 10:00 A.M. Fantastic guests talk about the Fake Impeachment! @FoxNews

Tweet: Our great Farmers will recieve another major round of “cash” compliments of China Tariffs prior to Thanksgiving. The smaller farms and farmers will be big beneficiaries. In the meantime and as you may have noticed China is starting to buy big again. Japan deal DONE. Enjoy!

Tweet: A BIG difference!

Tweet: Joe Ricketts one of our Country’s most successful businessmen including being the owner of the Chicago Cubs has just written a great new book THE HARDER YOU WORK THE LUCKIER YOU GET. So true! Much can be learned from Joe. Go get the book!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Dems are now doing even less - and soooo much work to be done!

Tweet: I agree Katrina Pam Bondi is a great woman!

Tweet: Paul Krugman has called me wrong from day one. People at the Failing New York Times are very angry at him for having “missed” by soooo much. Paul match over!

Tweet: Thanks Eric!

Tweet: .@SteveScalese blew the nasty &amp; obnoxious Chris Wallace (will never be his father Mike!) away on Chris’s lowest rated (unless I’m on) morning show. This kind of dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the @FoxNews past. Great job Steve!

Tweet: Paul Krugman of @nytimes has been wrong about me from the very beginning. Anyone who has followed his “words of wisdom” has lost a great deal of money. Paul just concede the game say I was right and lets start a brand new game!

Tweet: Tell Jennifer Williams whoever that is to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls &amp; see the just released ststement from Ukraine. Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers who I don’t know &amp; mostly never even heard of &amp; work out a better presidential attack!

Tweet: The Crazed Do Nothing Democrats are turning Impeachment into a routine partisan weapon. That is very bad for our Country and not what the Founders had in mind!!!!

Tweet: Republicans &amp; others must remember the Ukrainian President and Foreign Minister both said that there was no pressure placed on them whatsoever. Also they didn’t even know the money wasn’t paid and got the money with no conditions. But why isn’t Germany France (Europe) paying?

Tweet: Where is the Fake Whistleblower?

Tweet: “The Impeachment started before he even became President.” @greggutfeld @FoxNews

Tweet: “All they do is bring up witnesses who didn’t witness anything.” @KatrinaPierson @SteveHiltonx Nothing matters except the two transcripts of the presidential calls and the statement of no pressure put out by Ukraine!

Tweet: Never has the Republican Party been so united as it is now. 95% A.R. This is a great fraud being played out against the American people by the Fake News Media &amp; their partner the Do Nothing Democrats. The rules are rigged by Pelosi &amp; Schiff but we are winning and we will win!

Tweet: At my meeting with Jay Powell this morning I protested fact that our Fed Rate is set too high relative to the interest rates of other competitor countries. In fact our rates should be lower than all others (we are the U.S.). Too strong a Dollar hurting manufacturers &amp; growth!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats have disgraced our great Country!

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi just stated that “it is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump’s fate.” @FoxNews In other words she thinks I’m going to win and doesn’t want to take a chance on letting the voters decide. Like Al Green she wants to change our voting system. Wow she’s CRAZY!

Tweet: We join families of Kevin King &amp; Tim Weeks in celebrating their release from Taliban captivity. Thanks to President Ghani for his courageous support. Let’s hope this leads to more good things on the peace front like a ceasefire that will help end this long war. Proud of my team!

Tweet: The Republican Party and me had a GREAT day yesterday with respect to the phony Impeachment Hoax &amp; yet when I got home to the White House &amp; checked out the news coverage on much of television you would have no idea they were reporting on the same event. FAKE &amp; CORRUPT NEWS!

Tweet: “Freed Taliban hostages arrive in Germany.” @foxandfriends @FoxNews @OANN We got them back!

Tweet: I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word Impeachment! The calls (Transcripts) were PERFECT there was NOTHING said that was wrong. No pressure on Ukraine. Great corruption &amp; dishonesty by Schiff on the other side!

Tweet: “The new House Resolution gives Adam Schiff (the most dishonest man in politics) the power unilaterally to release edited transcripts. Rule 10 gives Chairman Schiff absolutely no jurisdiction. Subpoenas issued as part of Dems’ Impeachment inquiry are illegal.” Sam Dewey @FoxNews

Tweet: Adam Schiff will be compelled to testify should the Democrats decide despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate (perfect) to go forward with the Impeachment Hoax. Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment!

Tweet: Joe Concha The Hill: “In Emerson College Poll Impeachment among independents 49% Oppose 34% Support. You see why Pelosi is reluctant to go in with this. Dems have to go home and explain why they haven’t done something on Opioid crisis drug prices USMCA the Border etc.

Tweet: “The American people are going to see this for what it is. It is a political effort by the Democrats and the President certainly doesn’t have to aid in the Impeachment effort.” Robert Ray @MariaBartiromo Democrats are getting “killed” in their home districts. 2020!

Tweet: Heading to Europe to represent our Country and fight hard for the American People while the Do Nothing Democrats purposely scheduled an Impeachment Hoax hearing on the same date as NATO. Not nice!

Tweet: Thank you to Great Republican @SenJohnKennedy for the job he did in representing both the Republican Party and myself against Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd on Meet the Depressed!

Tweet: Not only did I see it @Doks_Art I think it is fantastic. You are a wonderful artist never give up your dream!

Tweet: The Republican Party has NEVER been so united! This Impeachment Scam is just a continuation of the 3 year Witch Hunt but it is only bringing us even closer together!

Tweet: When Lisa Page the lover of Peter Strzok talks about being “crushed” and how innocent she is ask her to read Peter’s “Insurance Policy” text to her just in case Hillary loses. Also why were the lovers text messages scrubbed after he left Mueller. Where are they Lisa?

Tweet: Great job by @RepDougCollins of Georgia over the weekend in representing the Republican Party and myself against the Impeachment Hoax!

Tweet: In the 3 decades before my election NATO spending declined by two-thirds and only 3 other NATO members were meeting their financial obligations. Since I took office the number of NATO allies fulfilling their obligations more than DOUBLED and NATO spending increased by $130B!

Tweet: Manufacturers are being held back by the strong Dollar which is being propped up by the ridiculous policies of the Federal Reserve - Which has called interest rates and quantitative tightening wrong from the first days of Jay Powell!

Tweet: The Fed should lower rates (there is almost no inflation) and loosen making us competitive with other nations and manufacturing will SOAR! Dollar is very strong relative to others.

Tweet: Just landed in the United Kingdom heading to London for NATO meetings tomorrow. Prior to landing I read the Republicans Report on the Impeachment Hoax. Great job! Radical Left has NO CASE. Read the Transcripts. Shouldn’t even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?

Tweet: Mini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any Democrat but to go after President Trump only. The Failing New York Times thinks that is O.K. because their hatred &amp; bias is so great they can’t even see straight. It’s not O.K.!

Tweet: Enjoyed my meeting with Prime Minister @BorisJohnson of the United Kingdom at @10DowningStreet last night. Talked about numerous subjects including @NATO and Trade.

Tweet: Thank you @NATO! #NATOLondon

Tweet: The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to belittle my VERY successful trip to London for NATO. I got along great with the NATO leaders even getting them to pay $130 Billion a year more &amp; $400 Billion a year more in 3 years. No increase for U.S. only deep respect!

Tweet: .@NATO has now recognized SPACE as an operational domain and the alliance is STRONGER for it. U.S. leadership ensures peace through strength and we must continue to show strength and WIN on all fronts – land air sea and SPACE!

Tweet: Just read the best Maureen Dowd column in the New York Times EVER (although she treated me great before politics) but it was written by her brother Kevin. Someone in the News Media should hire her wonderful talented and very smart brother!

Tweet: Tremendous things achieved for U.S. on my NATO trip. Proudly for our Country no President has ever achieved so much in so little time. Without a U.S. increase other countries have already increased by $130 Billion-with $400 Billion soon. Such a thing has never been done before!

Tweet: THANK YOU! #MAGA🇺🇸

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit. She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more. Stock Market and employment records. She says she “prays for the President.” I don’t believe her not even close. Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?

Tweet: Republican Approval Rating = 95%. Thank you!

Tweet: The story today that we are sending 12000 troops to Saudi Arabia is false or to put it more accurately Fake News!

Tweet: Where’s the Fake Whistleblower? Where’s Whistleblower number 2? Where’s the phony informer who got it all wrong?

Tweet: Do not believe any article or story you read or see that uses “anonymous sources” having to do with trade or any other subject. Only accept information if it has an actual living name on it. The Fake News Media makes up many “sources say” stories. Do not believe them!

Tweet: Nadler hasn’t had a single fact witness testify! Zero substance—Country wants #USMCA and Growth not Impeachment. Polls have tanked on the Do Nothing Democrats!

Tweet: Fake News @CNN is reporting that I am “still using personal cell phone for calls despite repeated security warnings.” This is totally false information and reporting. I haven’t had a personal cell phone for years. Only use government approved and issued phones. Retract!

Tweet: Why is the World Bank loaning money to China? Can this be possible? China has plenty of money and if they don’t they create it. STOP!

Tweet: Read the Transcripts! Also see where I say “us” (our Country) as opposed to “me” (meaning me) and where I then say that the Attorney General (of the United States) will call you. People still remember Schiff’s made up and fraudulent version of my conversation. Witch Hunt!

Tweet: While the world is not doing well economically our Country is doing better perhaps than it has ever done before. Jobs Jobs Jobs!

Tweet: Taken during the Obama Administration (despite $150 Billion gift) returned during the Trump Administration. Thank you to Iran on a very fair negotiation. See we can make a deal together!

Tweet: The United States will not rest until we bring every American wrongfully detained in Iran and around the world back home to their loved ones!

Tweet: Hard to believe but if Nancy Pelosi had put our great Trade Deal with Mexico and Canada USMCA up for a vote long ago our economy would be even better. If she doesn’t move quickly it will collapse!

Tweet: Our Economy is the envy of the World!

Tweet: “Why re-elect Democrats when you know that this is what they are doing with their majority. Their case is not strong because first it was Russian Collusion then it was obstruction then it was Ukraine now their pivoting back to Russia. Why would they be doing that?” Lisa Booth

Tweet: “Not only have the Democrats not advanced key pieces of legislation that would help the economy but the polls especially in early states are showing that voters are tuning out.” @PeteHegseth They don’t want our greatest of all presidents impeached!

Tweet: The United States Secret Service Deputy Assistant Director Anthony Ornato will become my new Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. I have worked with Tony for 3 years - he will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Dan Walsh for his great service and congratulations to Tony!

Tweet: @KimStrassel “Schiff’s surveillance (obtaining phone logs) is an unprecedented abuse of power.” To put it mildly. Also it is illegal!

Tweet: Congratulations to @TitoOrtiz on tonight’s huge WIN a Great American Patriot!

Tweet: Less than 48 hours before start of the Impeachment Hearing Hoax on Monday the No Due Process Do Nothing Democrats are believe it or not changing the Impeachment Guidelines because the facts are not on their side. When you can’t win the game change the rules!

Tweet: Don’t get why @FoxNews puts losers on like @RepSwalwell (who got ZERO as presidential candidate before quitting) Pramila Jayapal David Cicilline and others who are Radical Left Haters? The Dems wouldn’t let @FoxNews get near their bad ratings debates yet Fox panders. Pathetic!

Tweet: Great!

Tweet: To Impeach a President who has proven through results including producing perhaps the strongest economy in our country’s history to have one of the most successful presidencies ever and most importantly who has done NOTHING wrong is sheer Political Madness! #2020Election

Tweet: America’s great USMCA Trade Bill is looking good. It will be the best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA. Good for everybody - Farmers Manufacturers Energy Unions - tremendous support. Importantly we will finally end our Country’s worst Trade Deal NAFTA!

Tweet: Looking like very good Democrat support for USMCA. That would be great for our Country!

Tweet: Nadler just said that I “pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 Election.” Ridiculous and he knows that is not true. Both the President &amp; Foreign Minister of Ukraine said many times that there “WAS NO PRESSURE.” Nadler and the Dems know this but refuse to acknowledge!

Tweet: WITCH HUNT!

Tweet: Shifty Schiff a totally corrupt politician made up a horrible and fraudulent statement read it to Congress and said those words came from me. He got caught was very embarrassed yet nothing happened to him for committing this fraud. He’ll eventually have to answer for this!

Tweet: Read the Transcripts! “us” is a reference to USA not me!

Tweet: Just received a briefing on the horrific shootout that took place in Jersey City NJ. Our thoughts &amp; prayers are w/ the victims &amp; their families during this very difficult &amp; tragic time.

Tweet: “New Polls Say Most Americans Oppose Impeachment.” @foxandfriends I did nothing wrong. This will be the first Impeachment ever where there was no crime. They don’t even allege a crime. Crazy!

Tweet: It’s great to have a wonderful subject President Trump. Fake News like CNN &amp; MSNBC are dying. If they treated me fairly they would do well. Have Zero credibility!

Tweet: Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call. I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.

Tweet: I also have constantly asked “Why aren’t Germany France and other European countries helping Ukraine more? They are the biggest beneficiaries. Why is it always the good ol’ United States?” The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats never mention this at their phony hearing!

Tweet: “I think it’s obvious to all the American public that this is a railroad job!” @JimPressOffice

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi just got duped in an interview to admitting that she has been working on impeaching me for “two and a half years.” In other words she lied. This was the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats plan all along long before the Ukraine phone call. Impeachment Hoax!

Tweet: Looking like a big win for Boris in the U.K.!

Tweet: “Last night House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler admitted that Democrats are pursuing Impeachment because it’s too dangerous to simply let the American people pick the next president in 2020.” @kilmeade @FoxNews

Tweet: The Republicans House members were fantastic yesterday. It always helps to have a much better case in fact the Dems have no case at all but the unity &amp; sheer brilliance of these Republican warriors all of them was a beautiful sight to see. Dems had no answers and wanted out!

Tweet: My Approval Rating in the Republican Party is 95% a Record. Thank you! #2020Election

Tweet: Poll numbers have gone through the roof in favor of No Impeachment especially with Swing States and Independents in Swing States. People have figured out that the Democrats have no case it is a total Hoax. Even Pelosi admitted yesterday that she began this scam 2 1/2 years ago!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats have become the Party of lies and deception! The Republicans are the Party of the American Dream!

Tweet: The Republican Party is more united now than at any time in its history - by far!

Tweet: “All of our presidents would be impeached under this Rogue House of Democrat Leadership.” @marklevinshow

Tweet: “Independent voters are fed up and frustrated with the Democrats.” Congressman Michael Waltz Florida

Tweet: On my way to the #ArmyNavyGame in Philadelphia Pennsylvania!

Tweet: Chuck Schumer sat for years during the Obama Administration and watched as China ripped off the United States. He &amp; the Do Nothing Democrats did NOTHING as this $ carnage took place. Now without even seeing it he snipes at our GREAT new deal with China. Too bad Cryin’ Chuck!

Tweet: The last time I spoke to Debbie Dingell was her call thanking me for granting top memorial and funeral service honors for her then just departed husband long time Congressman John Dingell. Now I watch her ripping me as part of the Democrats Impeachment Hoax. Really pathetic!

Tweet: Congratulations @NavyFB!

Tweet: Hard to believe that @FoxNews will be interviewing sleazebag &amp; totally discredited former FBI Director James Comey &amp; also corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff. Fox is trying sooo hard to be politically correct and yet they were totally shut out from the failed Dem debates!

Tweet: Both Commiecast MSNBC &amp; Fake News CNN are watching their Ratings TANK. Fredo on CNN is dying. Don’t know why @FoxNews wants to be more like them? They’ll all die together as other outlets take their place. Only pro Trump Fox shows do well. Rest are nothing. How’s Shep doing?

Tweet: Wow that would be big. Always heard Jeff is very smart!

Tweet: Schiff’s correcting the record memo has turned out to be totally wrong (based on the I.G. Report)! A very big lie. @MariaBartiromo And @DevinNunes has turned out to be completely right. Congratulations to Devin. The Fake News Media should apologize to all!

Tweet: Crooked Hillary caught again. She is a total train wreck!

Tweet: Far from it!

Tweet: As bad as the I.G. Report is for the FBI and others and it is really bad remember that I.G. Horowitz was appointed by Obama. There was tremendous bias and guilt exposed so obvious but Horowitz couldn’t get himself to say it. Big credibility loss. Obama knew everything!

Tweet: A PERFECT phone call. “Can you do us (not me. Us is referring to our Country) a favor.” Then go on to talk about “Country” and “U.S. Attorney General.” The Impeachment Hoax is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which has been going on for 3 years. We will win! #MAGAKAG #2020

Tweet: So now Comey’s admitting he was wrong. Wow but he’s only doing so because he got caught red handed. He was actually caught a long time ago. So what are the consequences for his unlawful conduct. Could it be years in jail? Where are the apologies to me and others Jim?

Tweet: “There is no bribery or any crime at all alleged in the Articles of Impeachment. This is a first in the history of our Country.” @JudgeJeanine @RepMikeJohnson

Tweet: “The President did nothing wrong here. There is no crime.” @charliekirk11 Impeachment Hoax!

Tweet: The @foxnewPolls always inaccurate are heavily weighted toward Dems. So ridiculous - same thing happened in 2016. They got it all wrong. Get a new pollster!

Tweet: Approval Rating in Republican Party = 95% a Record! Overall Approval Rating = 51%. Think of where I’d be without the never ending 24 hour a day phony Witch Hunt that started 3 years ago!

Tweet: .@seanhannity who will be interviewed on @marklevinshow tonight at 8:00 P.M. @foxnews stated about the Impeachment Hoax “This is outrages lying corruption and propaganda. Should never be allowed to happen.”

Tweet: Fake News!

Tweet: Because Nancy’s teeth were falling out of her mouth and she didn’t have time to think!

Tweet: Congressional Do Nothing Democrats are being absolutely decimated in their districts on the subject of the Impeachment Hoax. People that voted for them are literally screaming in their faces. Crazy Nancy is finding defending Shifty Schiff harder than she thought! #2020Election

Tweet: Watch these two great people talk about the Impeachment Hoax. Will be by far the best hour on television!

Tweet: “The American people see through it.”

Tweet: READ THE TRANSCRIPTS! The Impeachment Hoax is the greatest con job in the history of American politics! The Fake News Media and their partner the Democrat Party are working overtime to make life for the United Republican Party and all it stands for as difficult as possible!

Tweet: Thank you CC!

Tweet: Thank you Devin. Great reflexes!

Tweet: Wow!

Tweet: New Stock Market high! I will never get bored of telling you that – and we will never get tired of winning!

Tweet: Congressman Jeff Van Drew is very popular in our great and very united Republican Party. It was a tribute to him that he was able to win his heavily Republican district as a Democrat. People like that are not easily replaceable!

Tweet: The Stock Market hit another Record High yesterday number 133 in less than three years as your all time favorite President and the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats want to impeach me. Don’t worry I have done nothing wrong. Actually they have!

Tweet: .@FoxNews “Trump wins major victories in China and USMCA trade deals defense spending and Space Force.” Thank you!

Tweet: Impeachment Poll numbers are starting to drop like a rock now that people are understanding better what this whole Democrat Scam is all about!

Tweet: The new USA Today Poll just out has me leading all of the Democrat contenders. That’s hard to believe since the Fake News &amp; 3 year Scams and Witch Hunts as phony as they are just never seem to end. The American people are smart. They see the great economy &amp; everything else!

Tweet: Would be sooo great if the Fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease. The Dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation. This is the time to do it. Exports would zoom!

Tweet: We support @JeanineAnez in Bolivia as she works to ensure a peaceful democratic transition through free elections. We denounce the ongoing violence and those that provoke it both in Bolivia and from afar. The U.S. stands with the people of the region for peace and democracy!

Tweet: Wow! “In a stunning rebuke of the FBI the FISA court severly chastised the FBI for the FISA abuses brought to light in the recent Inspector General’s Report. There were at least 17 significant errors.” @FoxNews Statement by the Court was long and tough. Means my case was a SCAM!

Tweet: Democrat “leadership” despite their denials are putting tremendous pressure on their members to vote yes on this ridiculous Impeachment. If they vote yes it will be much easier for Republicans to win in 2020!

Tweet: Good marks and reviews on the letter I sent to Pelosi today. She is the worst! No wonder with people like her and Cryin’ Chuck Schumer D.C. has been such a mess for so long - and that includes the previous administration who (and now we know for sure) SPIED on my campaign.

Tweet: .@marcthiessen “Voters say the Democrats are trying to take away their votes. Pelosi was right the first time. Impeachment has backfired thoroughly on the Democrats. How can you Impeach the President for going to the courts?”

Tweet: .@foxandfriends “My hope is that impeachment will never become this trivial again.” @kilmeade Well said Brian!

Tweet: Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats AND I DID NOTHING WRONG! A terrible Thing. Read the Transcripts. This should never happen to another President again. Say a PRAYER!

Tweet: “They just wanted to get at the President. They had no intention of having a proper investigation. They couldn’t find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of Congress which every administration from the beginning has done.” @RepDougCollins @foxandfriends

Tweet: 100% Republican Vote. That’s what people are talking about. The Republicans are united like never before!

Tweet: I got Impeached last might without one Republican vote being cast with the Do Nothing Dems on their continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in American history. Now the Do Nothing Party want to Do Nothing with the Articles &amp; not deliver them to the Senate but it’s Senate’s call!

Tweet: “The Senate shall set the time and place of the trial.” If the Do Nothing Democrats decide in their great wisdom not to show up they would lose by Default!

Tweet: PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!

Tweet: I got Impeached last night without one Republican vote being cast with the Do Nothing Dems on their continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in American history. Now the Do Nothing Party want to Do Nothing with the Articles &amp; not deliver them to the Senate but it’s Senate’s call!

Tweet: The great USMCA Trade Deal (Mexico &amp; Canada) has been sitting on Nancy Pelosi’s desk for 8 months she doesn’t even know what it says &amp; today after passing by a wide margin in the House Pelosi tried to take credit for it. Labor will vote for Trump. Trade deal is great for USA!

Tweet: So after the Democrats gave me no Due Process in the House no lawyers no witnesses no nothing they now want to tell the Senate how to run their trial. Actually they have zero proof of anything they will never even show up. They want out. I want an immediate trial!

Tweet: The House Democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the Republicans on their Impeachment Hoax. The Republicans have never been so united! The Dem’s case is so bad that they don’t even want to go to trial!

Tweet: The reason the Democrats don’t want to submit the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they don’t want corrupt politician Adam Shifty Schiff to testify under oath nor do they want the Whistleblower the missing second Whistleblower the informer the Bidens to testify!

Tweet: “This is political malpractice. This is a horrible judgement call on the part of the Speaker. You put your members in Trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot. It’s only going to extend it out further. This looks like the joke that it actually is.” Ben Domenech

Tweet: I guess the magazine “Christianity Today” is looking for Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders or those of the socialist/communist bent to guard their religion. How about Sleepy Joe? The fact is no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals or religion itself!

Tweet: Thank you to Franklin Graham for stating that his father the late great Billy Graham voted for me in the 2016 Election. I know how pleased you are with the work we have all done together!

Tweet: Last year I signed legislation that gives our Veterans CHOICE through private providers and at urgent care facilities! Today we fully funded this $10 billion a year effort that gets our brave Veterans care quickly and close to home.

Tweet: A total Witch Hunt!

Tweet: We will always provide for our Veterans and their mental health. I pushed Congress to provide $10 Billion for Vet mental health suicide prevention outreach and funding for my PREVENTS Initiative to end Vet suicide. Congress responded. A big win for our Vets!

Tweet: Honored to finally put an end to the “Widow’s Tax” and ensure that our surviving military spouses receive their full benefits. The spouses and families of our fallen heroes have suffered enough and WE must do everything in our power to ease the burden.

Tweet: My Administration pushed to include a big expansion to Veteran telehealth in the spending bill so that the brave men and women who served our Country get the care they need. #RuralProsperity

Tweet: Proud of @JimInhofe’s tenacious Oklahoma spirit that got the NDAA done. Maybe the best yet because it takes care of troops &amp; establishes SPACE FORCE which is 1st new branch since 1947 (Air Force). Another huge win for Jim’s legacy. To many more! @SASCMajority

Tweet: BIG thank you to Mac Thornberry (@MacTXPress) for a GREAT Defense Deal! Mac has been a champion for our Military and Vets his whole career and now he can add Space Force to his accomplishments. Look forward to another great defense bill next year Mac! @HASCRepublicans

Tweet: Plus never did anything wrong. Read the Transcripts. A Democrat Hoax!

Tweet: The great Democrat disgrace. But we are winning!

Tweet: Last night I was so proud to have signed the largest Defense Bill ever. The very vital Space Force was created. New planes ships missiles rockets and equipment of every kind and all made right here in the USA. Additionally we got Border Wall (being built) funding. Nice!

Tweet: Crazy Nancy wants to dictate terms on the Impeachment Hoax to the Republican Majority Senate but striped away all Due Process no lawyers or witnesses on the Democrat Majority House. The Dems just wish it would all end. Their case is dead their poll numbers are horrendous!

Tweet: Melania and I send our warmest wishes to Jewish people in the United States Israel and across the world as you commence the 8-day celebration of Hanukkah.

Tweet: The Democrats and Crooked Hillary paid for &amp; provided a Fake Dossier with phony information gotten from foreign sources pushed it to the corrupt media &amp; Dirty Cops &amp; have now been caught. They spied on my campaign then tried to cover it up - Just Like Watergate but bigger!

Tweet: Pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the U.S. Congress and now she is crying for fairness in the Senate and breaking all rules while doing so. She lost Congress once she will do it again!

Tweet: Wouldn’t it be reasonable to assume that Republicans in the Senate should handle the Impeachment Hoax in the exact same manner as Democrats in the House handled their recent partisan scam? Why would it be different for Republicans than it was for the Radical Left Democrats?

Tweet: I agree 100%!

Tweet: NASDAQ UP 72.2% SINCE OUR GREAT 2016 ELECTION VICTORY! DOW UP 55.8%. The best is yet to come!

Tweet: The ONLY reason we were able to get our great USMCA Trade Deal approved was because the Do Nothing Democrats wanted to show that they could approve something productive in light of the fact that all they even think about is impeachment. She knows nothing about the USMCA Deal!

Tweet: 187 new Federal Judges have been confirmed under the Trump Administration including two great new United States Supreme Court Justices. We are shattering every record! Read all about this in “The Long Game” a great new book by @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell. Amazing story!

Tweet: Thank you Tammy. You are doing a GREAT job!

Tweet: Wow. It’s all a giant SCAM!

Tweet: “Look the House is supposed to do all of this work on witnesses and documents BEFORE they send the articles over to the Senate not to call in new witnesses go through new documents - that work is supposed to be done in the House.” @KatiePavlich @foxandfriends

Tweet: The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats said they wanted to RUSH everything through to the Senate because “President Trump is a threat to National Security” (they are vicious will say anything!) but now they don’t want to go fast anymore they want to go very slowly. Liars!

Tweet: Brad Blakeman “I happen to believe as a lawyer that the charges are defective they don’t meet the Constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors so I would like to see a Motion to Dismiss. At least 51 Republican Senators would agree with that-there should be no trial.”

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi’s District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come to the homeless &amp; crime. It has gotten so bad so fast - she has lost total control and along with her equally incompetent governor Gavin Newsom it is a very sad sight!

Tweet: “Nancy Pelosi has no leverage over the Senate. Mitch McConnell did not nose his way into the impeachment process in the House and she has no standing in the Senate.” Brad Blakeman. Crazy Nancy should clean up her filthy dirty District &amp; help the homeless there. A primary for N?

Tweet: Russia Syria and Iran are killing or on their way to killing thousands if inocent civilians in Idlib Province. Don’t do it! Turkey is working hard to stop this carnage.

Tweet: Despite all of the great success that our Country has had over the last 3 years it makes it much more difficult to deal with foreign leaders (and others) when I am having to constantly defend myself against the Do Nothing Democrats &amp; their bogus Impeachment Scam. Bad for USA!

Tweet: California leads the nation by far in both the number of homeless people and the percentage increase in the homeless population - two terrible stats. Crazy Nancy should focus on that in her very down district and helping her incompetent governor with the big homeless problem!

Tweet: Now that wasn’t very nice was it?

Tweet: The Wall is funded &amp; being built!

Tweet: California and New York must do something about their TREMENDOUS Homeless problems. They are setting records! If their Governors can’t handle the situation which they should be able to do very easily they must call and “politely” ask for help. Would be so easy with competence!

Tweet: Crazy Nancy Pelosi should spend more time in her her decaying city and less time on the Impeachment Hoax!

Tweet: I want to thank Rush Limbaugh for the tremendous support he has given to the MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Movement and our KEEP AMERICA GREAT Agenda! He is a major star who never wavered despite the Fake News Hits he has had to endure. His voice is far bigger than theirs!

Tweet: So sad to see that New York City and State are falling apart. All they want to do is investigate to make me hate them even more than I should. Governor Cuomo has lost control and lost his mind. Very bad for the homeless and all!

Tweet: Thank you to highly respected Jewish leader Dov Hikind for his wonderful statements about me this morning on @foxandfriends.

Tweet: He is Fake News will always be Fredo to us. I should release some of his dishonest interviews? Coupled with bad ratings he’d be out!

Tweet: Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the congregation of yesterday’s church attack. It was over in 6 seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect 242 fellow worshippers. Lives were saved by these heroes and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!

Tweet: The Democrats will do anything to avoid a trial in the Senate in order to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and expose the millions and millions of dollars that “Where’s” Hunter &amp; possibly Joe were paid by companies and countries for doing NOTHING. Joe wants no part of this mess!

Tweet: Iran killed an American contractor wounding many. We strongly responded and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy and so notified!

Tweet: Armed congregants quickly stopped a crazed church shooter in Texas. If it were not for the fact that there were people inside of the church that were both armed and highly proficient in using their weapon the end result would have been catastrophic. A big THANK YOU to them!

Tweet: President Putin of Russia called to thank me and the U.S. for informing them of a planned terrorist attack in the very beautiful city of Saint Petersburg. They were able to quickly apprehend the suspects with many lives being saved. Great &amp; important coordination!

Tweet: I will be signing our very large and comprehensive Phase One Trade Deal with China on January 15. The ceremony will take place at the White House. High level representatives of China will be present. At a later date I will be going to Beijing where talks will begin on Phase Two!

Tweet: Very good meeting on the Middle East the Military and Trade. Heading back to The Southern White House (Mar-a-Lago!). Updates throughout the day.

Tweet: Read the Transcripts!

Tweet: Remember when Pelosi was screaming that President Trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly. They didn’t get one Republican House vote and lost 3 Dems. They produced no case so now she doesn’t want to go to the Senate. She’s all lies. Most overrated person I know!

Tweet: As hard as I work &amp; as successful as our Country has become with our Economy our Military &amp; everything else it is ashame that the Democrats make us spend so much time &amp; money on this ridiculous Impeachment Lite Hoax. I should be able to devote all of my time to the REAL USA!

Tweet: They attacked us &amp; we hit back. If they attack again which I would strongly advise them not to do we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!

Tweet: The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment. We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World! If Iran attacks an American Base or any American we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!

Tweet: These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target the United States will quickly &amp; fully strike back &amp; perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless!

Tweet: “The reason they are not sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic.” @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo The great Scam continues. To be spending time on this political Hoax at this moment in our history when I am so busy is sad!

Tweet: The Impeachment Hoax just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election must end quickly. Read the Transcripts see the Ukrainian President’s strong statement NO PRESSURE - get this done. It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election!

Tweet: Congress &amp; the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote &amp; we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!

Tweet: IRAN WILL NEVER HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!

Tweet: Amazing analysis &amp; reporting!

Tweet: We love Australia!

Tweet: Great interview with @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy on @foxandfriends. “There was no urgency with the Articles of Impeachment because there was no case.”

Tweet: All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties &amp; damages taking place now. So far so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.

Tweet: See you later!

Tweet: WINRED!

Tweet: Great!

Tweet: Pelosi doesn’t want to hand over The Articles of Impeachment which were fraudulently produced by corrupt politicians like Shifty Schiff in the first place because after all of these years of investigations and persecution they show no crimes and are a joke and a scam!

Tweet: Thank you Elise!

Tweet: PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!

Tweet: Hope that all House Republicans will vote against Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s War Powers Resolution. Also remember her “speed &amp; rush” in getting the Impeachment Hoax voted on &amp; done. Well she never sent the Articles to the Senate. Just another Democrat fraud. Presidential Harassment!

Tweet: She will go down as perhaps the least successful Speaker in U.S. History!

Tweet: Will be interviewed tonight by Laura @IngrahamAngle at 10pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy!

Tweet: “FBI Director apologizes for FISA Errors (of which there were far to many to be a coincidence!).” @FoxNews Chris what about all of the lives that were ruined because of the so-called “errors?” Are these “dirty cops” going to pay a big price for the fraud they committed?

Tweet: Where have the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of Qassem Soleimani one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? He was also looking to do big future damage! Dems are “unhinged.”

Tweet: New polling shows that the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax is going nowhere. A vast majority want the Do Nothing Democrats to move on to other things now!

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi will go down as the absolute worst Speaker of the House in U.S. history!

Tweet: Now the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats are asking @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell to do the job that they were unable to do. They proved NOTHING but my total innocence in the House despite the most unfair &amp; biased hearings in the history of Congress. Now they demand fairness!

Tweet: 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party a record. 53% Approval Rating overall (can we add 7 to 10 percent because of the Trump “thing?”). Thank you!

Tweet: The powerful Trump Wall is replacing porous useless and ineffective barriers in the high traffic areas requested by Border Patrol. Illegal crossing are dropping as more and more Wall is being completed! #BuildingTheWall

Tweet: To the brave long-suffering people of Iran: I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely and are inspired by your courage.

Tweet: به مردم شجاع و رنج کشیده ایران: من از ابتدای دوره ریاست جمهوریم با شما ایستاده‌ام و دولت من همچنان با شما خواهد ایستاد. ما اعتراضات شما را از نزدیک دنبال می کنیم. شجاعت شما الهام بخش است.

Tweet: The government of Iran must allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground on the ongoing protests by the Iranian people. There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching.

Tweet: دولت ایران باید به گروه‌های حقوق بشر اجازه بدهد حقیقت کنونی اعتراضات در جریان مردم ایران را نظارت کرده و گزارش بدهند. نباید شاهد کشتار دوباره ی معترضان مسالمت آمیز و یا قطع اینترنت باشیم. جهان نظاره گر این اتفاقات است.

Tweet: I hope the House and Senate Democrats in particular watch this. It is a classic. Thank you to @JudgeJeanine Pirro!

Tweet: Congratulations to @serenawilliams on another big win. She is a great player and an even greater person. Our members in Virginia (Tennis) will never forget you!

Tweet: To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you and the World is watching. More importantly the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!

Tweet: George @GStephanopoulos ask Crazy Nancy why she allowed Adam “Shifty” Schiff to totally make up my conversation with the Ukrainian President &amp; read his false words to Congress and the world as though I said it? He got caught! Ask why hearing was most unfair &amp; biased in history?

Tweet: John Kerry got caught essentially admitting that funds given ridiculously to Iran were used to fund attacks on the USA. Only a complete fool would have given that 150 Billion Dollars Plus to Iran. They then went on a Middle East Rampage! @foxandfriends @PeteHegseth

Tweet: “Pelosi has made a mockery of Impeachment. Her Articles are so weak. But more importantly she thought she could extort the Senate. She couldn’t.” @GreggJarrett @foxandfriends The Do Nothing Democrats are really run by the Radical Left. Too bad!

Tweet: Great idea. This phony Impeachment Hoax should not even be allowed to proceed. Did NOTHING wrong. Just a partisan vote. Zero Republicans. Never happened before!

Tweet: Why did Nervous Nancy allow corrupt politician Shifty Schiff to lie before Congress? He must be a Witness and so should she!

Tweet: Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did nothing wrong. Read the Transcripts! Hose Republicans voted 195-0 plus we got three Dems. Very unfair to tens of millions of voters!

Tweet: Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did NOTHING wrong? Read the Transcripts! A totally partisan Hoax never happened before. House Republicans voted 195-0 with three Dems voting with the Republicans. Very unfair to tens of millions of voters!

Tweet: خطاب به رهبران ايران: معترضان خود را نكشيد. هزاران تن تاكنون به دست شما كشته يا زنداني شده اند، و جهان نظاره گر است. مهمتر از ان، ايالات متحده نظاره گر است. اينترنت را دوباره وصل كنيد و به خبرنگاران اجازه دهيد ازادانه حركت كنند! كشتار مردم بزرگ ايران را متوقف كنيد!

Tweet: You can’t make this up! David Kris a highly controversial former DOJ official was just appointed by the FISA Court to oversee reforms to the FBI’s surveillance procedures. Zero credibility. THE SWAMP! @DevinNunes @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews

Tweet: Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party. So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!

Tweet: Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence no crime read the transcripts “no pressure” Impeachment Hoax rather than an outright dismissal it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!

Tweet: National Security Adviser suggested today that sanctions &amp; protests have Iran “choked off” will force them to negotiate. Actually I couldn’t care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but no nuclear weapons and “don’t kill your protesters.”

Tweet: مشاور امنیت ملی امروز عنوان کرد كه تحریم ها و اعتراضات، ایران را«به شدت تحت فشار»قرار داده است و آنها را مجبور به مذاكره می كند.در واقع، اصلا برایم اهمیتی نداردکه آیا آنها مذاکره می کنند یا نه.این کاملاً به عهده ی خودشان است، اما سلاح هسته ای نداشته باشیدو«معترضان خود را نکشید.»

Tweet: Bernie Sander’s volunteers are trashing Elizabeth “Pocahontus” Warren. Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. Mini Mike B is also trying but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?

Tweet: The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was “eminent” or not &amp; was my team in agreement. The answer to both is a strong YES. but it doesn’t really matter because of his horrible past!

Tweet: The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy only because I did what should have been done for 20 years. Anything I do whether it’s the economy military or anything else will be scorned by the Rafical Left Do Nothing Democrats!

Tweet: Wow! The wonderful Iranian protesters refused to step on or in any way denigrate our Great American Flag. It was put on the street in order for them to trample it and they walked around it instead. Big progress!

Tweet: The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was “imminent” or not &amp; was my team in agreement. The answer to both is a strong YES. but it doesn’t really matter because of his horrible past!

Tweet: Really Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker who was in zero polling territory just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!

Tweet: “We demand fairness” shouts Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats yet the Dems in the House wouldn’t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions. It was the most unfair witch-hunt in the history of Congress!

Tweet: I stand stronger than anyone in protecting your Healthcare with Pre-Existing Conditions. I am honored to have terminated the very unfair costly and unpopular individual mandate for you!

Tweet: Cryin’ Chuck Schumer just said “The American people want a fair trial in the Senate.” True but why didn’t Nervous Nancy and Corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff give us a fair trial in the House. It was the most lopsided &amp; unfair basement hearing in the history of Congress!

Tweet: Thank you Milwaukee Wisconsin! #KAG2020 #MAGA

Tweet: Former National Security Adviser for President Obama said “President Trump was absolutely correct” in taking out terroristist leader Soleimani. Thank you General Jones!

Tweet: Steyer is running low on cash. Nobody knows him. Made his money on coal. So funny!

Tweet: Now up to 187 Federal Judges and two great new Supreme Court Justices. We are in major record territory. Hope EVERYONE is happy!

Tweet: I agree with him on this 100%. But why would anyone vote Democrat? We are setting all time records with the economy!

Tweet: Here we go again another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House not the Senate!

Tweet: One of the greatest trade deals ever made! Also good for China and our long term relationship. 250 Billion Dollars will be coming back to our Country and we are now in a great position for a Phase Two start. There has never been anything like this in U.S. history! USMCA NEXT!

Tweet: Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is saying privately that the new China Trade Deal is unbelievable which it is but publicly he knocks it whenever possible. That’s politics but so bad for our great Country!

Tweet: “There is no crime here. I just think this whole thing should be rejected out of hand. I wouldn’t waste a minute of taxpayer dollars or time on this. Entertaining this Impeachment is a joke.” Laura Ingraham @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews

Tweet: The farmers are really happy with the new China Trade Deal and the soon to be signed deal with Mexico and Canada but I hope the thing they will most remember is the fact that I was able to take massive incoming Tariff money and use it to help them get through the tough times!

Tweet: Mini Mike Bloomberg doesn’t get on the Democrat Debate Stage because he doesn’t want to - he is a terrible debater and speaker. If he did he would go down in the polls even more (if that is possible!).

Tweet: Mini Mike Bloomberg ads are purposely wrong - A vanity project for him to get into the game. Nobody in many years has done for the USA what I have done for the USA including the greatest economy in history rebuilding our military biggest ever tax &amp; regulation cuts &amp; 2nd A!

Tweet: Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia. That’s what happens when you vote for Democrats they will take your guns away. Republicans will win Virginia in 2020. Thank you Dems!

Tweet: The noble people of Iran—who love America—deserve a government that's more interested in helping them achieve their dreams than killing them for demanding respect. Instead of leading Iran toward ruin its leaders should abandon terror and Make Iran Great Again!

Tweet: مردم نجیب ایران، که آمریکا را دوست می دارند، سزاوار دولتی هستند که بیش از تمرکز بر کشتن آنها به جرم احترام خواهی، به آنها کمک کند تا به رؤیاهایشان دست یابند. رهبران ایران به جای آن که ایران را به سمت ویرانی بکشانند، باید هراس افکنی را کنار بنهند و ایران را دوباره باعظمت کنند!

Tweet: A massive 200 Billion Dollar Sea Wall built around New York to protect it from rare storms is a costly foolish &amp; environmentally unfriendly idea that when needed probably won’t work anyway. It will also look terrible. Sorry you’ll just have to get your mops &amp; buckets ready!

Tweet: I have never seen the Republican Party as Strong and as Unified as it is right now. Thank you!

Tweet: Now Mini Mike Bloomberg is critical of Jack Wilson who saved perhaps hundreds of people in a Church because he was carrying a gun and knew how to use it. Jack quickly killed the shooter who was beginning a rampage. Mini is against the 2nd A. His ads are Fake just like him!

Tweet: I was thrilled to be back in the Great State of Texas tonight where the people are known for being tough strong hardworking loyal and fiercely patriotic — just like America’s incredible Farmers! #AFBF2020

Tweet: The Democrat House would not give us lawyers or not one witness but now demand that the Republican Senate produce the witnesses that the House never sought or even asked for? They had their chance but pretended to rush. Most unfair &amp; corrupt hearing in Congressional history!

Tweet: No matter what you give to the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats it will never be enough!

Tweet: It’s amazing what I’ve done the most of any President in the first three years (by far) considering that for three years I’ve been under phony political investigations and the Impeachment Hoax! KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: Thank you Wildwood New Jersey!

Tweet: Democrats are now the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism and blatant corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American Worker the American Family and the American Dream! #TrumpRallyNJ #KAG2020

Tweet: If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died to secure—then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020. Only this way can we save the America we love – and drain the Washington Swamp once and for all!

Tweet: No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats no matter how much information is given like the quickly produced Transcripts it will NEVER be enough for them. They will always scream UNFAIR. The Impeachment Hoax is just another political CON JOB!

Tweet: Why didn’t John Bolton complain about this “nonsense” a long time ago when he was very publicly terminated. He said not that it matters NOTHING!

Tweet: 175000 ticket requests. Keep America Great!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: Democrats admitting the Impeachment Hoax!

Tweet: Remember Republicans the Democrats already had 17 witnesses we were given NONE! Witnesses are up to the House not up to the Senate. Don’t let the Dems play you!

Tweet: Mark Penn Harris Poll: “It’s time to end the Impeachment Trial.” @foxandfriends Just another political Hoax by the Dems!

Tweet: On the Iraq War Resolution being voted on tomorrow in the House of Represenatives we are down to 5000 soldiers and going down and I want everyone Republican and Democrat to vote their HEART!

Tweet: There is much talk that certain Democrats are going to be voting with Republicans on the Impeachment Hoax so that the Senate can get back to the business of taking care of the American people. Sorry but Cryin’ Chuck Schumer will never let that happen!

Tweet: “The best evidence is the Transcript itself.” Brad Blakeman @FoxNews

Tweet: They will never be satisfied!

Tweet: Just received a briefing on the Coronavirus in China from all of our GREAT agencies who are also working closely with China. We will continue to monitor the ongoing developments. We have the best experts anywhere in the world and they are on top of it 24/7!

Tweet: “Schiff blasted for not focusing on California homeless.” @foxandfriends His District is in terrible shape. He is a corrupt pol who only dreams of the Impeachment Hoax. In my opinion he is mentally deranged!

Tweet: Great photos from a SOUTHERN BORDER WALL Briefing with Secretary of Defense Mark @EsperDoD!

Tweet: Congressman Brian @Babin4Congress of Texas has been a strong supporter of our #MAGA Agenda. He is strong on the Second Amendment and Securing our Border he Loves our Great Vets and Military. Brian has my Complete and Total Endorsement!

Tweet: Congressman @MichaelCBurgess has done a Great job representing the people of Texas. He continues to protect your very important Second Amendment. Mike is Strong on Crime and the Border he Loves our Great Vets and Military. Mike has my Complete and Total Endorsement!

Tweet: Just landed in Michigan. Car companies and many others are building and expanding here. Great to see!

Tweet: BIGGEST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE the USMCA was signed yesterday and the Fake News Media barely mentioned it. They never thought it could be done. They have zero credibility!

Tweet: Leaving Michigan now great visit heading for Iowa. Big Rally!

Tweet: Working closely with China and others on Coronavirus outbreak. Only 5 people in U.S. all in good recovery.

Tweet: Great poll in Iowa where I just landed for a Big Rally! #KAG2020🇺🇸

Tweet: Thank you Iowa I love you!

Tweet: This November we are going to defeat the Radical Socialist Democrats and win the Great State of Iowa in a Historic Landslide! #KAG2020

Tweet: To keep America Safe we have fully rebuilt the U.S. Military – it is now stronger more powerful and more lethal than ever before. Thanks to the courage of American Heroes the ISIS Caliphate has been DESTROYED &amp; its founder &amp; leader – the animal known as al-Baghdadi – is DEAD!

Tweet: Washington Dems have spent the last 3 years trying to overturn the last election – and we will make sure they face another crushing defeat in the NEXT ELECTION. Together we are going to win back the House we are going to hold the Senate &amp; we are going to keep the White House!

Tweet: Americans across the political spectrum are disgusted by the Washington Democrats’ Partisan Hoaxes Witch Hunts &amp; Con Jobs. Registered Democrats and Independents are leaving the Democrat Party in droves &amp; we are welcoming these voters to the Republican Party w/ wide open arms!

Tweet: THE BEST IS YET TO COME!

Tweet: Nadler ripped final argument away from Schiff thinks Shifty did a terrible job. They are fighting big time!

Tweet: Incredible numbers!

Tweet: The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting “fairness” when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress. They had 17 Witnesses we were allowed ZERO and no lawyers. They didn’t do their job had no case. The Dems are scamming America!

Tweet: Democrats = 17 Witnesses. Republicans = 0 Witnesses.

Tweet: No matter what you give to the Democrats in the end they will NEVER be satisfied. In the House they gave us NOTHING!

Tweet: Congratulations to @loudobbs Number One. Lou has shown the Fake News what happens when you cover “America’s Greatest President” fairly &amp; objectively! #MAGA #KAG

Tweet: Trump poll numbers are the highest since election despite constant phony Witch Hunts! Tens of thousands of people attending rallies (which the Fake News never mentions) to see “The Greatest Show On Earth”. Fun because USA is WINNING AGAIN!

Tweet: Getting a little exercise this morning!

Tweet: Such a great common sense question. Crazy!

Tweet: Happy birthday to a wonderful man &amp; friend!

Tweet: Thank you John!

Tweet: Wall is moving along strong tall and quickly. Thank you Jim for all of your help!

Tweet: Thanks for your invaluable help Chuck!

Tweet: Correct!

Tweet: The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats don’t want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election &amp; that includes the House &amp; Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far!

Tweet: Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact Bloomberg isn’t covering himself (too boring to do) or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It’s all the Fake News Media and that’s why nobody believes in them any more.

Tweet: Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere just wasting his money but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie something they wouldn’t do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again 2016.

Tweet: Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage and to have the right to stand on boxes or a lift during the debates. This is sometimes done but really not fair!

Tweet: My @SuperBowl Interview at 3:30 P.M. on @foxnetworks. Enjoy!

Tweet: ENJOY THE GAME USA OUR COUNTRY IS DOING GREAT!

Tweet: I promised to restore hope in America. That includes the least among us. Together let’s KEEP AMERICA GREAT! Text TRUMP to 88022 if you liked our Super Bowl ad!

Tweet: Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback under immense pressure. You represented the Great State of Kansas and in fact the entire USA so very well. Our Country is PROUD OF YOU!

Tweet: The DNC on Bernie Sanders “Looks like they’re going to do it to him again doesn’t it?” @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends

Tweet: @LindseyGrahamSC

Tweet: I hope Republicans &amp; the American people realize that the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax is exacty that a Hoax. Read the Transcripts listen to what the President &amp; Foreign Minister of Ukraine said (“No Pressure”). Nothing will ever satisfy the Do Nothing Radical Left Dems!

Tweet: Republicans in Iowa go out and Caucus today. Your great Trade Deals with China Mexico Canada Japan South Korea and more are DONE. Great times are coming after waiting for decades for our Farmers Ranchers Manufacturers and ALL. Nobody else could have pulled this off!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: Where’s the Whistleblower? Where’s the second Whistleblower? Where’s the Informer? Why did Corrupt politician Schiff MAKE UP my conversation with the Ukrainian President??? Why didn’t the House do its job? And sooo much more!

Tweet: Many people do not know what a great guy &amp; fantastic political talent the great Rush Limbaugh is. There is nobody like him. Looking for a speedy recovery for our friend!

Tweet: Big WIN for us in Iowa tonight. Thank you!

Tweet: The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is “Trump”.

Tweet: It is not the fault of Iowa it is the Do Nothing Democrats fault. As long as I am President Iowa will stay where it is. Important tradition!

Tweet: When will the Democrats start blaming RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA instead of their own incompetence for the voting disaster that just happened in the Great State of Iowa?

Tweet: The Democrat Party in Iowa really messed up but the Republican Party did not. I had the largest re-election vote in the history of that great state by far beating President Obama’s previous record by a lot. Also 97% Plus of the vote! Thank you Iowa!

Tweet: Market up big today on very good economic news. JOBS JOBS JOBS!

Tweet: My Approval Rating in the Republican Party = 95% a record! Big Iowa win. Approval Rating overall = 53% a new high. With our great Economy and other major successes would be 20 points higher without the phony Witch Hunts and Hoaxes???

Tweet: #SOTU2020

Tweet: It was a great and triumphant evening for our Country. Thank you for all of the nice remarks and wonderful reviews of my State of the Union Speech. It was my great honor to have done it!

Tweet: Thank you Jonathan and great job!

Tweet: “The Democrats want to run a Country and they can’t run a Caucus.” Brad Blakeman @FoxNews Iowa is a complete disaster for the Dems. They should bring in Mini Mike Bloomberg ASAP!

Tweet: I will be making a public statement tomorrow at 12:00pm from the @WhiteHouse to discuss our Country’s VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax!

Tweet: “What Really Happened”

Tweet: @nytimes “The Votes Were A Resounding Victory For Mr. Trump.” True but the Impeachment Hoax was just a continuation of the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats corrupt practices!

Tweet: Had failed presidential candidate @MittRomney devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering Barack Obama as he sanctimoniously does to me he could have won the election. Read the Transcripts!

Tweet: So true!

Tweet: Nevada I hear you on Yucca Mountain and my Administration will RESPECT you! Congress and previous Administrations have long failed to find lasting solutions – my Administration is committed to exploring innovative approaches – I’m confident we can get it done!

Tweet: Welcome back to Earth @Astro_Christina and congratulations on breaking the female record for the longest stay in space! You’re inspiring young women and making the USA proud! Enjoyed speaking with you and @Astro_Jessica on the first all-female spacewalk IN HISTORY last year.

Tweet: “This President has done more for African Americans in this Country than any President since Lincoln.” @LouDobbs

Tweet: “The Senate acquitted President Trump of both charges fabricated by Congressional Democrats led by Speaker Pelosi and Adam Schiff to carry out the most egregious and partisan attack against any president in our history - a man they knew to be innocent.” @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness

Tweet: Don’t worry it won’t happen!

Tweet: Thank you Charlie!

Tweet: So do I!

Tweet: Very true thank you Ted &amp; John. I love Texas!

Tweet: Welcome back James!

Tweet: I think they should blame RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA again! If they can’t count votes properly how are they going to run U.S. HealthCare?

Tweet: The Democrat Party has given up on counting votes in Iowa. Looks like it all got computer “fried”. Nobody knows who the real winner is. Maybe it’s Sleepy Joe but it’s not looking that way. They lost millions &amp; millions of dollars all for NOTHING. But I WON Iowa big!

Tweet: Off to North Carolina!

Tweet: Iowa and New Hampshire will not be moved from the Primary Schedule as long as I am President. Great tradition!

Tweet: JOBS JOBS JOBS!#PromisesMadePromisesKept🇺🇸

Tweet: Another win just in. Nervous Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress sued me thrown out. This one unanimous in the D.C. Circuit.Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Great to be in Charlotte North Carolina as we expand and grow this unprecedented economic momentum. Today we launched a brand new nationwide campaign to revitalize under-served cities and towns across America – it’s called OPPORTUNITY NOW!

Tweet: After years building up other countries we are finally rebuilding OUR Country. From our inner cities to our rural communities the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten NO LONGER! #OpportunityNow

Tweet: Not good!

Tweet: Thank you Iowa for the RECORD vote we just received in the Primary. The Dems were 25% down (although their votes are all fried!).

Tweet: Crazy Nancy Pelosi’s Impeachment Hoax has lifted Republican Congressional Polls (she lost the House once before!) and my Polls WAY UP which was expected but it has had a great effect on Republican Senate races including North Carolina Kentucky Colorado and Arizona. Thanks!

Tweet: The only way to stop the crazed Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats “is for the Republican Senate to run an offense here”. @LeeSmithDC @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews So true although the Dems Hoaxes &amp; Witch Hunts have driven up Republican Polls and mine mightily!

Tweet: We will not be touching your Social Security or Medicare in Fiscal 2021 Budget. Only the Democrats will destroy them by destroying our Country’s greatest ever Economy!

Tweet: More Fake News. This was photoshopped obviously but the wind was strong and the hair looks good? Anything to demean!

Tweet: Governor Cuomo wanted to see me this weekend. He just canceled. Very hard to work with New York - So stupid. All they do is sue me all the time!

Tweet: Total and complete Endorsement for Debbie Lesko! @RepDLesko Love Arizona.

Tweet: Pete Rose played Major League Baseball for 24 seasons from 1963-1986 and had more hits 4256 than any other player (by a wide margin). He gambled but only on his own team winning and paid a decades long price. GET PETE ROSE INTO THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME. It’s Time!

Tweet: A great coach and a fantastic guy. His endorsement of me in Indiana was a very big deal!

Tweet: Great lineup on @FoxNews tonight with @JesseBWatters @JudgeJeanine and &amp; @greggutfeld. All starts at 8:00 P.M. Will be discussing and explaining the Impeachment Hoax!

Tweet: Law Enforcement has been notified. Be careful tough guys who you play with!

Tweet: Thank you to everyone for all of the great reviews I have gotten on my State of the Union Speech. It was an immense honor for me to have presented it to you and the citizens of our very strong and wonderful Country!

Tweet: The feeling of many about @MittRomney!

Tweet: Leading also in New Hampshire and most states. The Fake News hates to report this but you will see on November 3rd.

Tweet: The Dems are crazed they will do anything. Honesty &amp; truth don’t matter to them. They are badly wounded. Iowa vote count was a disaster for them!

Tweet: I grew up in New York City and over many years got to watch how GREAT NYC’s “Finest” are. Now because of weak leadership at Governor &amp; Mayor stand away (water thrown at them) regulations and lack of support our wonderful NYC police are under assault. Stop this now!

Tweet: DeFace the Nation will tell @LindseyGrahamSC that he must start up Judiciary and not stop until the job is done. Clean up D.C. now last chance!

Tweet: This will never get old!

Tweet: This is so true!

Tweet: Yes!!!!!

Tweet: Romney hurt some very good Republican Senators and he was wrong about the Impeachment Hoax. No clue!

Tweet: They are really mad at Senator Joe Munchkin in West Virginia. He couldn’t understand the Transcripts. Romney could but didn’t want to!

Tweet: “They (Conservatives) thought the merits of the Impeachment case were weak and therefore his (Romney’s) judgement is questioned.” @MZHemingway @HowardKurtz @FoxNews

Tweet: It’s all turning and fast! MVP Heckler.

Tweet: Sabato got it all wrong last time never came close to understanding the Trump Voter. Actually it’s simple MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: .@LarrySabato is much better at giving you the answer after everything is finished and the final result is in than he is at telling you what is going to happen because in fact he doesn’t have a clue!

Tweet: So good to see that Republicans will be winning the Great State of Alabama Senate Seat back now that lightweight Senator @DougJones cast a partisan vote for the Impeachment Hoax. Thought his boss Cryin’ Chuck would have forced him to vote against the Hoax. A Do Nothing Stiff!

Tweet: DRAIN THE SWAMP!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: Will be in Manchester New Hampshire tonight for a big Rally. Want to shake up the Dems a little bit - they have a really boring deal going on. Still waiting for the Iowa results votes were fried. Big crowds in Manchester!

Tweet: 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party a Record! 53% overall (plus add 9 points?). Corrupt Democrat politicians have brought me to highest polling numbers ever with the Impeachment Hoax. Thank you Nancy!

Tweet: Because of how badly they did with the Impeachment Hoax AOC will primary Cryin’ Chuck Schumer and win and Jerry Nadler has a good chance of losing to his far left primary opponent! It is all getting quite interesting. Pelosi will lose the House AGAIN! My poll numbers great.

Tweet: Hope the Fake News which never discusses it is talking about the big crowds forming for my New Hampshire Rally tonight. They won’t!

Tweet: Thank you to @mirandadevine of the New York Post for your interesting (and correct) column today. “Trump has gained 20 points since Impeachment began in October. He gets 67% on economy. Nonwhite approval of Trump is also at a high: 28% up 10 points in a year. Nice one Nancy.”

Tweet: Meeting with U.S. Governors in a short while. All States are doing well. “Thank you Mr. President.”

Tweet: Wall Street Journal Editorial: “She (Crazy Nancy) aimed at Trump and hit Uncle Joe.”

Tweet: “A lot of people feel defeated...Trump always wins. It seems like nothing can stop him.” Danny Villazon @nytimes @DanaPerino @FoxNews But isn’t that what you want from your President?

Tweet: THANK YOU NEW HAMPSHIRE!

Tweet: TOUGH GUYS FOR TRUMP!

Tweet: Should never happen to another President!

Tweet: Disgraceful!

Tweet: Nice conflict. Brown dropped out of presidential race FAST. Polled at ZERO!

Tweet: Just returned to White House from Dover. Very sad!

Tweet: This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!

Tweet: BEST USA ECONOMY IN HISTORY!

Tweet: WOW BLOOMBERG IS A TOTAL RACIST!

Tweet: Great being in New Hampshire last night. I would say that was the biggest political Rally in New Hampshire history. Incredible evening!

Tweet: New Stock Market RECORD. Congratulations spend your money wisely. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!!

Tweet: Mini Mike is a short ball (very) hitter. Tiny club head speed. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

Tweet: When Jerome Powell started his testimony today the Dow was up 125 &amp; heading higher. As he spoke it drifted steadily downward as usual and is now at -15. Germany &amp; other countries get paid to borrow money. We are more prime but Fed Rate is too high Dollar tough on exports.

Tweet: All starting to unravel with the ridiculous 9 year sentence recommendation!

Tweet: Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure? How did she treat Crooked Hillary Clinton? Just asking!

Tweet: Whatever happened to Hillary campaign manager Podesta’s BROTHER? Wasn’t he caught forced to leave his firm with BIG BAD things to happen? Why did nothing ever happen to him only to the “other” side?

Tweet: Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is having a really bad night. I think she is sending signals that she wants out. Calling for unity is her way of getting there going home and having a “nice cold beer” with her husband!

Tweet: Impeachment King Steyer (how did that work out?) spent 200 Million Dollars and got less than 1% of the vote in Iowa and only 3% of the Vote in New Hampshire. Could it be that something is just plain missing? Not easy to do what I did is it?

Tweet: Who are the four prosecutors (Mueller people?) who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal the Mueller Scam and shouldn’t ever even have started? 13 Angry Democrats?

Tweet: A lot of Democrat dropouts tonight very low political I.Q.

Tweet: A very bad night for Mini Mike!

Tweet: Bootedgeedge (Buttigieg) is doing pretty well tonight. Giving Crazy Bernie a run for his money. Very interesting!

Tweet: Prosecutorial Misconduct?

Tweet: Thank you Brad!

Tweet: The Fake News Media is looking hard for the Big Democrat Story but there is nothing too fabulous. Wouldn’t a big story be that I got more New Hampshire Primary Votes than any incumbent president in either party in the history of that Great State? Not an insignificant fact!

Tweet: Fake News @CNN and MSDNC have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in New Hampshire (and in Iowa). That’s why they are poorly rated Fake News! I will win both states in November.

Tweet: Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought &amp; tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!

Tweet: Two months in jail for a Swamp Creature yet 9 years recommended for Roger Stone (who was not even working for the Trump Campaign). Gee that sounds very fair! Rogue prosecutors maybe? The Swamp! @foxandfriends @TuckerCarlson

Tweet: .@dagenmcdowell “Every Democrat is running to raise taxes. She (Pocahontas) lied about her ethnicity that was her problem.” @MariaBartiromo So true Dagen!

Tweet: Now it looks like the fore person in the jury in the Roger Stone case had significant bias. Add that to everything else and this is not looking good for the “Justice” Department. @foxandfriends @FoxNews

Tweet: “Deven Nunes predicts that more examples of Mueller team misconduct will be revealed in coming weeks.” @seanhannity @FoxNews

Tweet: Mini Mike Bloomberg is a LOSER who has money but can’t debate and has zero presence you will see. He reminds me of a tiny version of Jeb “Low Energy” Bush but Jeb has more political skill and has treated the Black community much better than Mini!

Tweet: Mini Mike is a 5’4” mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians. No boxes please. He hates Crazy Bernie and will with enough money possibly stop him. Bernie’s people will go nuts!

Tweet: DRAIN THE SWAMP! We want bad people out of our government!

Tweet: When I terminated John Kelly which I couldn’t do fast enough he knew full well that he was way over his head. Being Chief of Staff just wasn’t for him. He came in with a bang went out with a whimper but like so many X’s he misses the action &amp; just can’t keep his mouth shut.

Tweet: I’m seeing Governor Cuomo today at The White House. He must understand that National Security far exceeds politics. New York must stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits &amp; harrassment start cleaning itself up and lowering taxes. Build relationships but don’t bring Fredo!

Tweet: “The President has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case.” A.G. Barr This doesn’t mean that I do not have as President the legal right to do so I do but I have so far chosen not to!

Tweet: “President Trump with smart policies has done more to help the Black community than any President in the modern era.” @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews

Tweet: 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!

Tweet: It is happening again to Crazy Bernie just like last time only far more obvious. They are taking the Democrat Nomination away from him and there’s very little he can do. A Rigged System!

Tweet: Last week the Fake News said that a section of our powerful under construction Southern Border Wall “fell over” trying to make it sound terrible except the reason was that the concrete foundation was just poured &amp; soaking wet when big winds kicked in. Quickly fixed “forever”.

Tweet: #DAYTONA500

Tweet: HAPPY PRESIDENT’S DAY!

Tweet: I would like to thank John Rood for his service to our Country and wish him well in his future endeavors!

Tweet: Internal REAL Polls show I am beating all of the Dem candidates. The Fake News Polls (here we go again just like 2016) show losing or tied. Their polls will be proven corrupt on November 3rd just like the Fake News is corrupt!

Tweet: Rod Blagojevich did not sell the Senate seat. He served 8 years in prison with many remaining. He paid a big price. Another Comey and gang deal! Thank you to @LisaMarieBoothe who really “gets” what’s going on! @FoxNews

Tweet: Heading to Arizona big rally and big crowd! #MAGA #KAG2020

Tweet: I AM ON MY WAY SEE YOU SOON!

Tweet: Wow!

Tweet: A beautiful evening in Phoenix Arizona with Great American Patriots. THANK YOU!

Tweet: The Democrat party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late-term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican Party is the party of the American Worker the American Family and the American Dream!

Tweet: “What has happened to Roger Stone should never happen to anyone in our Country again.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews

Tweet: Thank you Arizona! With your help your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep ON WINNING! America is thriving like never before and the BEST IS YET TO COME!

Tweet: Mini Mike Bloomberg’s debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates and there have been some really bad ones. He was stumbling bumbling and grossly incompetent. If this doesn’t knock him out of the race nothing will. Not so easy to do what I did!

Tweet: .@JRubinBlogger (Jennifer Rubin) the wacko “conservative” of the @washingtonpost must learn how to spell the name Bloomberg before it is too late &amp; he is gone!

Tweet: This is the REAL Mini Mike. He admitted many times that he is “a fan of Donald Trump. He’s a New York ICON.” Thank you Mike!

Tweet: A really great moment!

Tweet: This makes Mini Mike look good compared to his performance last night. Worst debate performance in history!

Tweet: “They say Roger Stone lied to Congress.” @CNN OH I see but so did Comey (and he also leaked classified information for which almost everyone other than Crooked Hillary Clinton goes to jail for a long time) and so did Andy McCabe who also lied to the FBI! FAIRNESS?

Tweet: John Kerry and Senator Chris Murphy grossly violated the Logan Act with respect to Iran. If a Republican did what they did there would be very serious ramifications!

Tweet: “I don’t think there’s any chance whatsoever of Senator Sanders defeating President Trump.” Mini Mike Bloomberg. Mini there’s even less chance especially after watching your debate performance last night of you winning the Democrat nomination...But I hope you do!

Tweet: “The decision not to prosecute Andy McCabe is utterly inexplicable.” @Judgenap @HARRISFAULKNER @FoxNews

Tweet: “The real winner last night was Donald Trump.” Mini Mike Bloomberg. I agree!

Tweet: It was my great honor to deliver the commencement address at the @LVMPD’s Hope for Prisoners Graduation Ceremony today where we reaffirmed that America is a nation that believes in REDEMPTION!

Tweet: Could somebody at @foxnews please explain to Trump hater A.B. Stoddard (zero talent!) and @TeamCavuto that I won every one of my debates from beginning to end. Check the polls taken immediately after the debates. The debates got me elected. Must be Fox Board Member Paul Ryan!

Tweet: Just arrived in Colorado see everyone soon!

Tweet: Wow thank you — on my way!!

Tweet: I was thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs tonight beneath the majestic peaks of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific hardworking American Patriots. With your help this November we are going to defeat the Radical Socialist Dems and we are going to WIN Colorado!

Tweet: Thank you to our great US Ambassador to Germany @RichardGrenell for stepping in to serve as acting DNI. I will be nominating a terrific candidate for the job very soon. Stay tuned!

Tweet: Great Rally In Colorado. Thank you will be back soon!

Tweet: IF OUR FORMALLY TARGETED FARMERS NEED ADDITIONAL AID UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE TRADE DEALS WITH CHINA MEXICO CANADA AND OTHERS FULLY KICK IN THAT AID WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAID FOR OUT OF THE MASSIVE TARIFF MONEY COMING INTO THE USA!

Tweet: Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to after two weeks count their votes in Iowa. Hoax number 7!

Tweet: Great!

Tweet: Four great candidates are under consideration at DNI. Decision within next few weeks!

Tweet: Mitch and I have made great progress. Coming back fast!

Tweet: @SenateGOP Highest Trump Poll Numbers EVER! Thank you!

Tweet: So @TeamCavuto has very bad ratings on @foxnews with his Fake guests like A.B.Stoddard and others that still haven’t figured it all out. Will he get the same treatment as his friend Shepherd Smith who also suffered from the ratings drought?

Tweet: ON MY WAY!

Tweet: THANK YOU Las Vegas Nevada! I was delighted to be back in a state I love with proud hardworking PATRIOTS. With your help this November we are going to defeat the Radical Socialist Democrats and we are going to win Nevada in a landslide! #KAG2020

Tweet: Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community &amp; every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism excitement energy &amp; enthusiasm. We are welcoming Americans of all parties &amp; political persuasions to join our incredible movement to #MAGA!

Tweet: MSDNC (Comcast Slime) @CNN and others of the Fake Media have now added Crazy Bernie to the list of Russian Sympathizers along with @TulsiGabbard &amp; Jill Stein (of the Green Party) both agents of Russia they say. But now they report President Putin wants Bernie (or me) to win.

Tweet: Simply put he choked!

Tweet: Good luck Angela!

Tweet: Incredible people great Rally!

Tweet: “An investigation into NOTHING.” The wonderful @trish_regan on the Mueller Witch Hunt!

Tweet: Democrats in the Great State of Nevada (Which because of the Economy Jobs the Military &amp; Vets I will win in November) be careful of Russia Russia Russia. According to Corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff they are pushing for Crazy Bernie Sanders to win. Vote!

Tweet: Wow great foresight!

Tweet: Look so forward to being with my great friends in INDIA!

Tweet: Looks like Crazy Bernie is doing well in the Great State of Nevada. Biden &amp; the rest look weak &amp; no way Mini Mike can restart his campaign after the worst debate performance in the history of Presidential Debates. Congratulations Bernie &amp; don’t let them take it away from you!

Tweet: “The Kremlin is reportedly backing Bernie Sanders bid to win the White House.” Jon Scott @FoxNews Why didn’t somebody tell me this?

Tweet: Just another Shifty Schiff leak. Isn’t there a law about this stuff?

Tweet: Departing for India with Melania!

Tweet: Look forward to being with all of my friends and supporters @CPAC on Saturday February 29th! #KAG2020

Tweet: Somebody please tell incompetent (thanks for my high poll numbers) &amp; corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff to stop leaking Classified information or even worse made up information to the Fake News Media. Someday he will be caught &amp; that will be a very unpleasant experience!

Tweet: Are any Democrat operatives the DNC or Crooked Hillary Clinton blaming Russia Russia Russia for the Bernie Sanders win in Nevada. If so I suggest calling Bob Mueller &amp; the 13 Angry Democrats to do a new Mueller Report Democrat Edition. Bob will get to the bottom of it!

Tweet: Jeff Van Drew is a Courageous Leader that left the Do Nothing Democrats to better serve the Great people of New Jersey. HAPPY BIRTHDAY @CongressmanJVD!

Tweet: Crazy Bernie and the Democrats should see this. I I have done more

Tweet: Crazy Bernie and the Democrats should see this. I have done far more for the African American community than any President. Secured funding for HBCUs Criminal Justice Reform Opportunity Zones School Choice Record Low Unemployment and so much more. THE BEST IS YET TO COME!

Tweet: 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party a Record. 218 Federal Judges also a Record. 2 Supreme Court Justices. Thank you!

Tweet: Set up by Schiff’s lies &amp; leaks. Same with the Mueller Witch Hunt 3 years ago!

Tweet: The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC &amp; World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!

Tweet: Totally correct!

Tweet: Great new book just out “Taken for Granted How Conservatives Can Win Back Americans That Liberalism Failed” by Gianni Caldwell a young winner! He will be at the Ronald Reagan Library Simi Valley California on Thursday at 6 PM PT. Check it out!

Tweet: Spelled @GiannoCaldwell!

Tweet: “U.S. Intelligence official overstated assessment of Russian efforts to help Trump.” @FoxNews @GreggJarrett They supposedly told Crazy Bernie that Russia was looking at him not me. This is all a big scam between Intel and the Democrats. They want Bernie OUT &amp; hate “Trump”.

Tweet: Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is complaining for publicity purposes only that I should be asking for more money than $2.5 Billion to prepare for Coronavirus. If I asked for more he would say it is too much. He didn’t like my early travel closings. I was right. He is incompetent!

Tweet: There has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the Roger Stone case. Look at her background. She never revealed her hatred of “Trump” and Stone. She was totally biased as is the judge. Roger wasn’t even working on my campaign. Miscarriage of justice. Sad to watch!

Tweet: A total miscarriage of justice!

Tweet: True but we are getting it all done!

Tweet: No surprise!

Tweet: That is because they cover your favorite President relatively well. @CNN &amp; MSDNC are dying in the ratings!

Tweet: 52% in the new Rasmussen Poll. 95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you!

Tweet: An absolute disgrace!

Tweet: Russia wants him to win!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: “U.S. acted on the Coronavirus very very quickly.” Gordon Chang @IngrahamAngle

Tweet: They spied on my campaign!

Tweet: “Anti-Trump Network @CNN doing whatever it can to stoke a national Coronavirus panic. The far left Network pretty much ignoring anyone who they interview who doesn’t blame President Trump.” @trish_regan @FoxNews Media refuses to discuss the great job our professionals are doing!

Tweet: Do Nothing Democrats were busy wasting their time on the Impeachment Hoax &amp; anything they could do to make the Republican Party look bad while I was busy calling early boarder &amp; flight closings putting us way ahead in our battle with the Coronavirus. Dems called it very wrong!

Tweet: Congratulations and thank you to our great Vice President &amp; all of the many professionals doing such a fine job at CDC &amp; all other agencies on the Coronavirus situation. Only a very small number in U.S. &amp; China numbers look to be going down. All countries working well together!

Tweet: Word is that Mini Mike Bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates that he is thinking about dropping out of the Democrat Primary. The fact is he was not true to himself and the public was able to quickly figure him out. Not a good experience for Mini Mike!

Tweet: “Diagnosis positive: @CNN is infected with Trump Derangement Syndrome. I’m calling out CNN for irresponsibly politicizing what should be a unifying battle against a virus that doesn’t choose sides.” @trish_regan @FoxNews Like I say they are Fake News!

Tweet: So nice!

Tweet: So the Coronavirus which started in China and spread to various countries throughout the world but very slowly in the U.S. because President Trump closed our border and ended flights VERY EARLY is now being blamed by the Do Nothing Democrats to be the fault of “Trump”.

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats were busy wasting time on the Immigration Hoax &amp; anything else they could do to make the Republican Party look bad while I was busy calling early BORDER &amp; FLIGHT closings putting us way ahead in our battle with Coronavirus. Dems called it VERY wrong!

Tweet: “Federal Court Deals Major Blow To Sanctuary Cities.” @FoxNews In other words there will be no more Federal Tax Dollars to States &amp; Cities that will not cooperate with Federal Law Enforcement (ICE). This is BIG NEWS! Funds will be cut off immediately. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tweet: Will be in the Great State of South Carolina tonight 7:00 P.M. for a really BIG Rally. Best place to be is a Trump Rally. See you later!

Tweet: To the people of South Carolina Tom Steyer is a joke laughed at by everyone a total incompetent. He made money in coal now he “hates” coal. Did you see him fawning over Crazy Bernie? Has no chance a loser for South Carolina doesn’t deserve your vote!

Tweet: Worst Polls just like in 2016 when they were so far off the mark are the @FoxNews Polls. Why doesn’t Fox finally get a competent Polling Company?

Tweet: “You go around Pennsylvania and you see Trump signs everywhere. The Donald Trump situation is bigger than the Reagan Revolution. Donald Trump has inspired us.” @RjHarris15 WHP580

Tweet: We strongly stand with Terrence!

Tweet: Mini Mike is getting slammed. His debates were perhaps the worst in presidential debating history. A total phony who disavowed “Stop &amp; Frisk” after swearing by it for years and even recently. He horribly overused it &amp; then dropped when running as a Dem. A total phony!

Tweet: The Dems are working hard to take the prized nomination away from Bernie. Back room politics which Bernie is not very good at. His people will not let it happen again!

Tweet: Nobody fights harder for Montana than @SteveDaines. Steve is a close friend of mine a STRONG Conservative and a tremendous supporter of our #MAGA Agenda. He is strong on Crime &amp; Borders GREAT for our Military &amp; Vets &amp; will protect your #2A. Steve has my Complete Endorsement!

Tweet: On my way to the Great State of South Carolina. See everyone soon! #MAGA #KAG

Tweet: I am pleased to announce the nomination of @RepRatcliffe (Congressman John Ratcliffe) to be Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Would have completed process earlier but John wanted to wait until after IG Report was finished. John is an outstanding man of great talent!

Tweet: It was my great honor to be back in South Carolina tonight with thousands of hardworking American Patriots who believe in Faith Family God and Country. Thank you for a beautiful evening! #KAG2020

Tweet: Thank you to all of the incredible Law Enforcement Officers in South Carolina tonight. We love you!

Tweet: I hope we can get Admiral @RonnyJackson4TX of Texas who served our Country so well into the runoff election in #TX13! Ronny is strong on Crime and Borders GREAT for our Military and Vets and will protect your #2A. Get out and vote for Ronny on Tuesday March 3rd!

Tweet: A so-called reporter named @JohnJHarwood who bombed so badly in the 2016 Presidential Debates that I thought he was going to be immediately fired (a Mini Mike type performance) is now with Fake News @CNN. A total loser!

Tweet: South Carolina was GREAT. A BIG &amp; REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC CROWD!

Tweet: THANK YOU SOUTH CAROLINA!

Tweet: I will be having a 1:30 P.M. Press Conference at the White House to discuss the latest CoronaVirus developments. Thank you!

Tweet: THANK YOU @CPAC! #CPAC2020

Tweet: Dana you are the real deal!

Tweet: THE BEST IS YET TO COME!

Tweet: Sleepy Joe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s Joke of a campaign. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters taking many away!

Tweet: Democrats are working hard to destroy the name and reputation of Crazy Bernie Sanders and take the nomination away from him!

Tweet: Congratulations to Sleepy Joe Biden!

Tweet: Tom Steyer who other than Mini Mike Bloomberg spent more dollars for NOTHING than any candidate in history quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the Democrat Clown Show. Go away Tom and save whatever little money you have left!

Tweet: I would find it hard to believe that failed presidential candidates Tom Steyer or Mini Mike Bloombeg would contribute to the Democrat Party even against me after the way they have been treated - laughed at &amp; mocked. The real politicians ate them up and spit them out!

Tweet: Coronavirus: In addition to screening travelers “prior to boarding” from certain designated high risk countries or areas within those countries they will also be screened when they arrive in America. Thank you! @VP @SecAzar @CDCgov @CDCDirector

Tweet: A Poll in today’s New York Post says that 77% of “U.S. adults have confidence in their government’s ability to handle the Coronavirus (Number One) compared to other health threats.” 64% for Zika 58% for Ebola. Others way down on list. Our professionals are doing a great job!

Tweet: “Who better than @RepRatcliffe who got to the bottom of the FISAGATE &amp; RUSSIAGATE HOAX. It makes a lot of sense to put John Ratcliffe in there (DNI).The Senate should quickly approve him. @DevinNunes @MariaBartiromo John will do a great job for the American people!

Tweet: People are disgusted and embarrassed by the Fake News Media as headed by the @nytimes @washingtonpost @comcast &amp; MSDNC @ABC @CBSNews and more. They no longer believe what they see and read and for good reason. Fake News is indeed THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!

Tweet: Pete Buttigieg is OUT. All of his SuperTuesday votes will go to Sleepy Joe Biden. Great timing. This is the REAL beginning of the Dems taking Bernie out of play - NO NOMINATION AGAIN!

Tweet: Mini Mike Bloomberg didn’t bring NYC back as he said in his fake ad. It was @RudyGiuliani who brought NYC back and who also with his endorsement got Mini Mike elected (with barely a thank you). A boring mayor who the people couldn’t stand!

Tweet: The Black community brilliantly turned their backs on Mini Mike because they know he is a pandering phony who never did right by them!

Tweet: Thank you. I love you too!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: Sleepy Joe Biden also said that guns killed 150 million Americans last year wants to win Georgia on Super Tuesday (not up) and got his speaking location wrong again!

Tweet: Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd is not at the top of his game! Thank you.

Tweet: Watch Mark Levin interview of Charlie Kirk tonight at 11:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Amazing!!! And while you’re at it go get Charlie’s new book “The MAGA Doctrine: The Only Ideas That Will Win the Future”...This is a really GREAT book. Support Charlie Kirk!

Tweet: I am meeting with the major pharmaceutical companies today at the White House about progress on a vaccine and cure. Progress being made!

Tweet: “Ever since (Mini Mike) Bloomberg’s bad debate performances his support has dropped.” @abcnews Dropped a lot. Only his highly paid consultants who are laughing all the way to the bank still support him...And by the way he did not poll well as mayor in handling crisis!

Tweet: I was criticized by the Democrats when I closed the Country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended. Saved many lives. Dems were working the Impeachment Hoax. They didn’t have a clue! Now they are fear mongering. Be calm &amp; vigilant!

Tweet: Jack Welch former Chairman and CEO of GE a business legend has died. There was no corporate leader like “neutron” Jack. He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together. He will never be forgotten. My warmest sympathies to his wonderful wife &amp; family!

Tweet: .@FoxNews is working hard pushing the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats. They want to be unlike their competitors @CNN &amp; MSDNC (Comcast) Fair &amp; Balanced. When will they ever learn. The Radical Left never even gave @FoxNews permission to partake in their low rated debates!

Tweet: The only people in favor of Mini Mike continuing with his hapless campaign are me and his political consultants who are getting richer and richer by the day!

Tweet: The Democrats in the House should propose a very simple one year Payroll Tax cut. Great for the middle class great for the USA!

Tweet: WOW! Sleepy Joe doesn’t know where he is or what he’s doing. Honestly I don’t think he even knows what office he's running for!

Tweet: Thank you @JackBrewerBSI. We’re with you all the way. The American people know what’s going on they totally get it. Watch what happens in November 2020! Thank you for your continued support. Together we are going to KEEP AMERICA GREAT! #BlackVoicesforTrump

Tweet: The Federal Reserve is cuting but must further ease and most importantly come into line with other countries/competitors. We are not playing on a level field. Not fair to USA. It is finally time for the Federal Reserve to LEAD. More easing and cutting!

Tweet: The biggest loser tonight by far is Mini Mike Bloomberg. His “political” consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!

Tweet: Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren other than Mini Mike was the loser of the night. She didn’t even come close to winning her home state of Massachusetts. Well now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer!

Tweet: But they really knew who was going to win!

Tweet: THANK YOU UTAH! #KAG2020

Tweet: THANK YOU CALIFORNIA! #KAG2020

Tweet: The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders AGAIN! Even the fact that Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race was devastating to Bernie and allowed Sleepy Joe to unthinkably win Massachusetts. It was a perfect storm with many good states remaining for Joe!

Tweet: So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race. She has Zero chance of even coming close to winning but hurts Bernie badly. So much for their wonderful liberal friendship. Will he ever speak to her again? She cost him Massachusetts (and came in third) he shouldn’t!

Tweet: This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States &amp; then doesn’t have the wisdom or courage to stare down &amp; end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office and the Mueller Scam begins!

Tweet: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!

Tweet: I will be going to the Great State of Tennessee on Friday. The USA stands with the people of Tennessee 100% whatever they need! The tornadoes were of record size &amp; velocity. God bless your loved ones &amp; all of the families affected! Thanks to @GovBillLee &amp; @MarshaBlackburn

Tweet: The great people of Montana can have no better VOICE than Senator @SteveDaines. He is doing an incredible job! Whoever the Democrat nominee may be please understand that I will be working hard with Steve all the way &amp; last night I was 20 for 20 (per @GOPLeader). WE NEED STEVE!

Tweet: Wow! If Elizabeth Warren wasn’t in the race Bernie Sanders would have EASILY won Massachusetts Minnesota and Texas not to mention various other states. Our modern day Pocahontas won’t go down in history as a winner but she may very well go down as the all time great SPOILER!

Tweet: The Mayor of Los Angeles @ericgarcetti is dealing with us trying to get the Federal Government to fix the terrible problem he and the Dems have caused with the homeless and the horrendous effects it is having on the City which is a mess. I then watch him talk “trash” on me!

Tweet: Mini Mike Bloomberg just “quit” the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn’t have what it takes and he would have saved himself a billion dollars the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign hoping to save face. It won’t work!

Tweet: Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim O’Brien and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS. This has been the worst and most embarrassing experience of his life...and now on to Sleepy Joe!

Tweet: Mini Mike “Three months ago I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump (and I failed miserably!).

Tweet: Today it was my great honor to address the @LatinoCoalition Legislative Summit. With the hard work love &amp; devotion of millions of incredible Hispanic-Americans our Country is thriving our people are prospering and our future has never looked brighter!

Tweet: Pandering Mini Mike Bloomberg along with his wacky friend Tom Steyer have found out the hard way that you can’t buy the election! They both wish they had it to do over again!

Tweet: Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews. Enjoy!

Tweet: Congress has agreed to provide $8 Billion to fight Coronavirus! This means @CDC @HHSGov and @DHSgov will have the resources they need to Keep America Safe and keep the risk to workers and families very low. This is great news for our Health our Economy and our Nation!

Tweet: This is a direct &amp; dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court by Schumer. If a Republican did this he or she would be arrested or impeached. Serious action MUST be taken NOW!

Tweet: Retired Four Star General Jack Keane will recieve the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM next week!

Tweet: There can be few things worse in a civilized law abiding nation than a United States Senator openly and for all to see and hear threatening the Supreme Court or its Justices. This is what Chuck Schumer just did. He must pay a severe price for this!

Tweet: Retired Four Star General Jack Keane will receive the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM next week!

Tweet: I will be interviewed by @seanhannity on @FoxNews at 9:10 P.M.

Tweet: As per recent Federal Court ruling the Federal Government will be withholding funds from Sanctuary Cities. They should change their status and go non-Sanctuary. Do not protect criminals!

Tweet: I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats in particular MSDNC. Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly only looking to do harm to the incredible &amp; successful effort being made!

Tweet: Schumer has brought great danger to the steps of the United States Supreme Court!

Tweet: “I want to commend the President for how he has handled the CoronaVirus situation especially his early decision to shut down access into our Country from China despite strong opposition to that decision.” @SenTomCotton Thank you Tom!

Tweet: .@GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy informed me that I was 20 for 20 on Tuesday with respect to my Endorsement of candidates. Sadly I didn’t get that information from the Fake News Media. They don’t report those things or the far more than Dems cumulative votes despite no opposition!

Tweet: Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren who was going nowhere except into Mini Mike’s head just dropped out of the Democrat Primary...THREE DAYS TOO LATE. She cost Crazy Bernie at least Massachusetts Minnesota and Texas. Probably cost him the nomination! Came in third in Mass.

Tweet: “Joe Biden represents the past. President Trump represents the future.” @LisaMarieBoothe @edhenry @FoxNews

Tweet: With approximately 100000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide and 3280 deaths the United States because of quick action on closing our borders has as of now only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!

Tweet: Mini Mike you’re easy!

Tweet: The Department of Education is NOT closing hundreds of schools in rural areas of our Country. This is just more Fake News. We are investing greatly in our schools and always will!

Tweet: Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation. The April 2009-10 Swine Flu where nearly 13000 people died in the U.S. was poorly handled. Ask MSDNC &amp; lightweight Washington failure @RonaldKlain who the President was then?

Tweet: Thank you Nan!

Tweet: Tonight’s Fox News Town Hall with @MarthaMacCallum and @BretBaier will rebroadcast at 11:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews. Enjoy!

Tweet: Thank you Scranton Pennsylvania. It was a great evening!

Tweet: Thank you David a lifelong Democrat from Pennsylvania. We will continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then KEEP AMERICA

Tweet: We have appointed 220 Federal Judges and two Supreme Court Justices. PROMISES MADE PROMISES KEPT!

Tweet: The WALL is well under construction. So far we’re up to 129 miles and by early next year we will have 500 miles completed!

Tweet: Thank you Audrey!

Tweet: My great honor!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: Thanks Linda but they were really good last night!

Tweet: JOBS JOBS JOBS!!!

Tweet: I will protect your Social Security and Medicare just as I have for the past 3 years. Sleepy Joe Biden will destroy both in very short order and he won’t even know he’s doing it!

Tweet: It is FAKE NEWS that @HHSGov @SecAzar is “sidelined” from the great job he is doing on the CoronaVirus Task Force. He has the total confidence of the @VP and myself and is doing a fantastic job as the numbers would indicate!

Tweet: Spoke to Governor @GavinNewsom early this morning about the cruise ship quarantined off the California Coast. CoronaVirus test kits have been delivered testing is taking place now.

Tweet: My Administration is with you all of the way Tennessee. We love you!

Tweet: Thank you @GovBillLee. We are a phone call away and here for you!

Tweet: Congratulations to @FoxNews!

Tweet: Thank you @GovBillLee and @MariaLeeTN. My Administration will always be there for the Great People of Tennessee. Together we will prevail!

Tweet: Thank you to the Great State of Tennessee. We are with you all the way!

Tweet: I agree with Joe!

Tweet: Thank you

Tweet: We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus. We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!

Tweet: The New York Times is an embarrassment to journalism. They were a dead paper before I went into politics and they will be a dead paper after I leave which will be in 5 years. Fake News is the Enemy of the people!

Tweet: Who knows what this means but it sounds good to me!

Tweet: There are no mixed messages only political weaponization by people like you and your brother Fredo!

Tweet: Working hard Lori!

Tweet: A great book support Charlie BUY IT! Already Number One.

Tweet: The Fake News Media and their partner the Democrat Party is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General “The risk is low to the average American.”

Tweet: Cryin’ Chuck Schumer said “You will pay the price for this. You won’t know what HIT YOU.” That is far beyond simple rhetoric. That is a physical threat or at least a threat that you better vote for us.” Trouble ahead!

Tweet: Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T. He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?

Tweet: Now the Democrats are trying to smear Bernie with Russia Russia Russia. They are driving him Crazy!

Tweet: “Trump has outmastered the Deep State. He’s light years ahead of us.” MSDNC. I disagree. We have a long way to go. There are still some very bad sick people in our government - people who do not love our Country (In fact they hate our Country!).

Tweet: The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt Administration in the history of our Country!

Tweet: Great job being done by the @VP and the CoronaVirus Task Force. Thank you!

Tweet: The BEST decision made was the toughest of them all - which saved many lives. Our VERY early decision to stop travel to and from certain parts of the world!

Tweet: So much FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: Good for the consumer gasoline prices coming down!

Tweet: Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That and the Fake News is the reason for the market drop!

Tweet: So last year 37000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27000 and 70000 per year. Nothing is shut down life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths. Think about that!

Tweet: Congressman Michael Guest (@GuestCongress) is an incredible fighter for the Great State of Mississippi. Michael is strong on Crime and the Border he loves our Military and Vets. Michael has my Complete and Total Endorsement! Get out and Vote for Michael tomorrow March 10th!

Tweet: Congressman @StevenPalazzo is doing a fantastic job for the people of Mississippi. He strongly supports our #MAGA Agenda. Steven will continue to protect your #2A &amp; Support our INCREDIBLE Vets &amp; Military. Steven has my Complete Endorsement. VOTE for Steven tomorrow March 10th!

Tweet: THANK YOU Jim for your incredible support of our #MAGA Agenda! You are a tremendous Senator for the people of the Great State of Oklahoma and you have my Complete and Total Endorsement!

Tweet: Oklahoma Vote for your GREAT Senator Today. Nobody better than Jim!

Tweet: Fake News!!

Tweet: Going up fast. We need the Wall more than ever!

Tweet: Wow! @foxandfriends blew away the competition of Morning Joke (which did very poorly) on MSDNC (Another Comcast sleaze production) and @CNN’s New Day in the Morning Television Ratings. A total blowout but that’s what you get when you treat “Trump” fairly!

Tweet: Polls say they BOTH lose to “Trump”.

Tweet: Going to be a BAD day for Crazy Bernie!

Tweet: True with number 1 being more important!

Tweet: Well deserved Jack. A great honor!

Tweet: Our pathetic slow moving Federal Reserve headed by Jay Powell who raised rates too fast and lowered too late should get our Fed Rate down to the levels of our competitor nations. They now have as much as a two point advantage with even bigger currency help. Also stimulate!

Tweet: The Federal Reserve must be a leader not a very late follower which it has been!

Tweet: There is another Russia Russia Russia meeting today. It is headed up by corrupt politician Adam “Shifty” Schiff so I wouldn’t expect too much! @DHS_Wolf

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi just said “I don’t know if we can be ready this week.” In other words it’s off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. That’s been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!

Tweet: Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary!

Tweet: Ronald Reagan’s great economist the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom has just said great things about a Payroll Tax Cut!

Tweet: Thank you @SenateGOP!

Tweet: Great meeting on Capitol Hill with the @SenateGOP!

Tweet: If you like automobils how can you vote for a Democrat who all want to get rid of cars as quickly as possible especially if they are powered by gasoline. Remember also no more than one car per family. I on the other hand have new plants being built all over Michigan Plus!

Tweet: THANK YOU NORTH DAKOTA! #KAG2020

Tweet: THANK YOU WASHINGTON! #KAG2020

Tweet: Pocahontas working in conjunction with the Democrat Party totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders. If she would have quit 3 days earlier Sanders would have beaten Biden in a route it wouldn’t even have been close. They also got two other losers to support Sleepy Joe!

Tweet: THANK YOU IDAHO! #KAG2020

Tweet: Thank you Gavin. Team is doing a great job!

Tweet: Vanity Fair Magazine which will soon be out of business and their third rate Fake reporters who make up sources which don’t exist wrote yet another phony &amp; boring hit piece. The facts are just the opposite. Our team is doing a great job with CoronaVirus!

Tweet: Someone needs to tell the Democrats in Congress that CoronaVirus doesn’t care what party you are in. We need to protect ALL Americans!

Tweet: I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!

Tweet: I will be addressing the Nation this evening at 9:00 P.M. (Eastern) from the Oval Office.

Tweet: The Media should view this as a time of unity and strength. We have a common enemy actually an enemy of the World the CoronaVirus. We must beat it as quickly and safely as possible. There is nothing more important to me than the life &amp; safety of the United States!

Tweet: Hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both Republicans and Democrats and please remember very important for all countries &amp; businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.

Tweet: “Nancy Pelosi all of a sudden doesn’t like the payroll tax cut but when Obama proposed it she thought it was a brilliant thing that all of the working families would benefit from because if you get a paycheck you’re going to take home more money.” @kilmeade @foxandfriends

Tweet: Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to and happened with the illegal attempted “coup” of the duly elected President of the United States and others!

Tweet: 108 countries are dealing with the CoronaVirus problem some of which we are helping!

Tweet: Just had a great conversation with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I told him that the just completed Olympic venue is magnificent. He has done an incredible job one that will make him very proud. Good things will happen for Japan and their great Prime Minister. Lots of options!

Tweet: Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best with fast action of border closings &amp; a 78% Approval Rating the highest on record. His was lowest!

Tweet: “The Obama White House had to immediately issue an apology for Joe Biden’s remarks and any alarm that he might have caused an alarm about a Swine Flu outbreak that took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency and that killed 12000 Americans.” @LouDobbs

Tweet: If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly &amp; efficiently let them have the full money that they earned APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!

Tweet: The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks. Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic &amp; physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also STIMULATE!

Tweet: To this point and because we have had a very strong border policy we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders that number would be many times higher!

Tweet: I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 P.M. The White House. Topic: CoronaVirus!

Tweet: To unleash the full power of the Federal Government in this effort today I am officially declaring a National Emergency.

Tweet: We will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care they need. No resource will be spared!

Tweet: At my request effective midnight tonight Carnival Royal Caribbean Norwegian and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry – it will be kept that way!

Tweet: Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on earth...We will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they are entitled to. No resource will be spared.

Tweet: To those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones I want you to know that your Federal Government will unleash every authority resource and tool at its disposal to safeguard the lives and health of our people.

Tweet: Good teamwork between Republicans &amp; Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!

Tweet: Larry I am not surprised that Candace was great. I would only be surprised if she wasn’t great!

Tweet: BIGGEST STOCK MARKET RISE IN HISTORY YESTERDAY!

Tweet: Attending meetings on Covid-19 in the White House. Working with States and local governments many of whom have done a great job. Full report latter!

Tweet: SOCIAL DISTANCING!

Tweet: News Conference at White House in 10 minutes.

Tweet: Just finished a meeting on Covid-19 in the Situation Room news conference coming up shortly.

Tweet: THE UNITED STATES LOVES ITALY!

Tweet: COVID-19 UPDATE

Tweet: Just had a nice conversation with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau of Canada. Great to hear that his wonderful wife Sophie is doing very well. The United States and Canada will continue to coordinate closely together on COVID-19.

Tweet: The @CDCgov has published guidelines on to enable every American to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves their families and their communities.

Tweet: Tomorrow I have called for a National Day of Prayer. I will be tuning in to Pastor @Jentezen at the @FreeChapel Church in Gainesville Georgia at 11:00 AM EDT. God Bless the USA!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: Thank you Sara. Keep writing great talent!

Tweet: Amazing how the Fake News never covers this. No Interest on Student Loans. The Dems are just talk!

Tweet: This took place in the Rose Garden just coming out of a cold Winter!

Tweet: Great Job by Judicial Watch. Potentially a treasure trove. Too bad you are not given more help but it will all work out!

Tweet: TODAY IS A NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER. GOD BLESS EVERYONE!

Tweet: I am watching a great and beautiful service by Pastor Jentezen Franklin. Thank you! @Jentezen

Tweet: We are doing very precise Medical Screenings at our airports. Pardon the interruptions and delays we are moving as quickly as possible but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful. We must get it right. Safety first!

Tweet: Can’t believe they are not going after Schumer for the threats he made to our cherished United States Supreme Court and our two great Justices. If a Republican did that there would be an endless price to pay. Pathetic!

Tweet: So now it is reported that after destroying his life &amp; the life of his wonderful family (and many others also) the FBI working in conjunction with the Justice Department has “lost” the records of General Michael Flynn. How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!

Tweet: The Fake and Corrupt News never called Google. They said this was not true. Even in times such as these they are not truthful. Watch for their apology it won’t happen. More importantly thank you to Google!

Tweet: The individual Governors of States and local officials must step up their efforts on drive up testing and testing sights working in conjunction with @CDCgov and the Federal Government!

Tweet: I must say that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. That’s what they ALL said 4 years ago and nothing happened in fact I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting but they will. Be careful!

Tweet: God Bless the USA!

Tweet: Everybody is so well unified and working so hard. It is a beautiful thing to see. They love our great Country. We will end up being stronger than ever before!

Tweet: Just had a very good tele-conference with Nations’s Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to “do more”.

Tweet: Yesterday I spoke with the great American Grocers and Supply Chain Executives. We are confident that supply will continue to meet demand nationwide. These beacons of our community will remain open for you no matter what. We are working hard to remove any barriers to that effort!

Tweet: I ask all Americans to band together and support your neighbors by not hoarding unnecessary amounts of food and essentials. TOGETHER we will stay STRONG and overcome this challenge!

Tweet: The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries like Airlines and others that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!

Tweet: Great news Lindsey!

Tweet: The “Times” is a disgrace to journalism!

Tweet: Failing Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!

Tweet: Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials. Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS

Tweet: The world is at war with a hidden enemy. WE WILL WIN!

Tweet: For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies for instance the shutting down of hotels bars and restaurants money will soon be coming to you. The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!

Tweet: I will totally protect your Medicare &amp; Social Security!

Tweet: I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA concerning the Chinese Virus!

Tweet: I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously and have done a very good job from the beginning including my very early decision to close the “borders” from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful &amp; false!

Tweet: The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders fat ahead of schedule. Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters. Bernie has given up just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon! MAGA/KAG

Tweet: The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders far ahead of schedule. Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters. Bernie has given up just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon! MAGA/KAG

Tweet: Thank you to our great American businesses for going above and beyond to keep our most vulnerable citizens safe!

Tweet: 15 DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD!

Tweet: Today I spoke with American physicians and nurses to thank them for their tireless work. Doctors and nurses are at the front lines of this war and are true American HEROES! With their help America will WIN.

Tweet: Thank you @HerschelWalker!

Tweet: I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need but we are all in this TOGETHER!

Tweet: STRONG &amp; UNITED WE WILL PREVAIL!

Tweet: We are going to WIN sooner rather than later!

Tweet: SOCIAL DISTANCING!

Tweet: THANK YOU! #ThankATrucker

Tweet: THANK YOU to our Police Officers Fire Fighters and EMS who help us defeat the Virus every day. Our proud nation is grateful for the unwavering dedication and sacrifice of our First Responders and their families. TOGETHER we will beat this!

Tweet: America’s Private Sector is stepping up to help us be STRONG! Many of the Nation’s distillers large and small are producing and donating hand sanitizer to help fight #COVID19. THANK YOU!

Tweet: Steve is one of the very best in the Senate. He is competing against a failed Democrat Presidential candidate who never got close to 1% and was sent packing. Had to be talked into this run by Schumer. Bad for 2nd A! I strongly Endorse @SteveDaines!

Tweet: A Great Guy!

Tweet: Today I spoke with our Nation’s Small Businesses which employ nearly half of America’s workforce. We are taking the MOST aggressive action in history to deliver fast relief to your businesses and workers. We will always protect our Small Businesses! @SBAgov

Tweet: Thank you to Fred Smith and @FedEx for the rapid emergency deliveries you are making all over our Nation. Keep it going!

Tweet: Working very well with States and our Nation’s Governors. #TEAMWORK

Tweet: .@JBPritzker Governor of Illinois and a very small group of certain other Governors together with Fake News @CNN &amp; Concast (MSDNC) shouldn’t be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings. We are there to back you up should you fail and always will be!

Tweet: The hard working men and women of @UPS are working overtime to maintain our supply chain and deliver medical supplies to those in need. Your work is critical to the health of our nation keep it up!

Tweet: Will be having a News Conference from our beautiful White House at 5:00 P.M. Many things to discuss. Thank you!

Tweet: My friend (always there when I’ve needed him!) Senator @RandPaul was just tested “positive” from the Chinese Virus. That is not good! He is strong and will get better. Just spoke to him and he was in good spirits.

Tweet: I watch and listen to the Fake News CNN MSDNC ABC NBC CBS some of FOX (desperately &amp; foolishly pleading to be politically correct) the @nytimes &amp; the @washingtonpost and all I see is hatred of me at any cost. Don’t they understand that they are destroying themselves?

Tweet: WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!

Tweet: We will be guided by the wishes of Prime Minister Abe of Japan a great friend of the United States and a man who has done a magnificent job on the Olympic Venue as to attending the Olympic Games in Japan. He will make the proper decision!

Tweet: Robert we will end up stronger than ever before. Thank you!

Tweet: STRONG &amp; UNITED WE WILL PREVAIL! GOD BLESS THE

Tweet: THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS!

Tweet: The New York Times changed headlines 3 times in order to satisfy the Radical Left. What should have been a good story got “worse &amp; worse” until the headline alone made it very unfair. Fake &amp; Corrupt News that is very dangerous for our Country!

Tweet: A great early result from a drug that will start tomorrow in New York and other places! #COVIDー19

Tweet: Republicans had a deal until Nancy Pelosi rode into town from her extended vacation. The Democrats want the Virus to win? They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies. They want Open Borders &amp; Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn’t agree!

Tweet: The Hill/HarrisX: 61% to 39% Approval Rating on handling of Coronavirus situation. Thank you!

Tweet: This will never be approved by me or any other Republican!

Tweet: The World market for face masks and ventilators is Crazy. We are helping the states to get equipment but it is not easy. Just got 400 Ventilators for @NYCMayor Bill de Blasio. Work beginning on 4 hospitals in New York! Millions of different type items coming!

Tweet: Thank you Tony!

Tweet: The Media is hopeless. Too bad!

Tweet: A respected coal miner and great dad! Rest In Peace!

Tweet: Buy the book and give Liz some Great Reviews! @OANN

Tweet: Thank you Kirstie!

Tweet: Keep Charlie Number One. Great Book!

Tweet: The Defense Production Act is in full force but haven’t had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States.

Tweet: This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!

Tweet: Congress must approve the deal without all of the nonsense today. The longer it takes the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!

Tweet: Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else and Seniors will be watched over protectively &amp; lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!

Tweet: Will be doing a Town Hall on @FoxNews at 12:05 P.M. (Now). I will go on around 1:00 P.M. Enjoy!

Tweet: Price transparency is so important for the people of our Country. In many ways it will prove to be as important as healthcare itself. A great issue for both Republicans and Democrats. Hopefully it will be approved!

Tweet: TOGETHER WE WILL PREVAIL!

Tweet: “President Trump’s decision to very early on restrict travel from China saved tens of thousands of lives.” @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness

Tweet: I am working very hard to help New York City &amp; State. Dealing with both Mayor &amp; Governor and producing tremendously for them including four new medical centers and four new hospitals. Fake News that I won’t help them because I don’t like Cuomo (I do). Just sent 4000 ventilators!

Tweet: This is really great news! I am so happy I can barely speak. He may have been a terrible presidential candidate and an even worse U.S. Senator but he is a RINO and I like him a lot!

Tweet: Gee that’s too bad. Such a fine guy. Presidential aspirations you know!

Tweet: The Democrat’s Best &amp; Finest!

Tweet: Just reported that the United States has done far more “testing” than any other nation by far! In fact over an eight day span the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span. Great job!

Tweet: The four hospitals that we (FEMA) are building in NYC at the Javits Convention Center are moving along very well ahead of schedule. Many additional ventilators also delivered. Good conversation with Governor Cuomo!

Tweet: Congratulations to Prime Minister Abe of Japan and the IOC on their very wise decision to present the Olympics in 2021. It will be a great success and I look forward to being there!

Tweet: Today is National #MedalofHonorDay. Join me in a #MomentofHonor to remember those who have earned our Nation's highest award for valor in combat. The Nation is eternally grateful to these patriots who so valiantly fought for America’s values and the American way of life!

Tweet: The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!

Tweet: 96-0 in the United States Senate. Congratulations AMERICA!

Tweet: I will be doing a News Conference live from the @WhiteHouse at 5:00 P.M. (Eastern) to discuss the mtg of the G20 Leaders that took place this morning at 7:55 A.M. by World Teleconference. Also my 12:00 P.M. Teleconference call w/50 Governors plus Territories will be discussed.

Tweet: Will be going out in 10 minutes for the press conference.

Tweet: Our great Oil &amp; Gas industry is under under seige after having one of the best years in recorded history. It will get better than ever as soon as our Country starts up again. Vital that it does for our National Security!

Tweet: The world is at war with a hidden enemy. WE WILL WIN!

Tweet: Will be interviewed on @seanhannity at 9:10 P.M. @FoxNews

Tweet: Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much &amp; has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!

Tweet: By empowering the Radical Left Democrats do nothing Kentucky politician @RepThomasMassie is making their War on the 2nd Amendment more and more difficult to win (But don’t worry we will win anyway!). He is a disaster for America and for the Great State of Kentucky!

Tweet: Thank you Byron. Many polls are much better than this. If it is the Fake News @washingtonpost add 10 points!

Tweet: As usual with “this” General Motors things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40000 much needed Ventilators “very quickly”. Now they are saying it will only be 6000 in late April and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke “P”.

Tweet: General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio or some other plant and START MAKING VENTILATORS NOW!!!!!! FORD GET GOING ON VENTILATORS FAST!!!!!! @GeneralMotors @Ford

Tweet: Invoke “P” means Defense Production Act!

Tweet: We have just purchased many Ventilators from some wonderful companies. Names and numbers will be announced later today!

Tweet: Will someone please explain to the Fake News New York Times (ALL THE NEWS THAT’S NOT FIT TO PRINT) that the Democrats make it almost impossible for us to fill positions within government. They “maximum” delay even the best candidates including Judges leaving little time!

Tweet: Thousand of Federal Government (delivered) Ventilators found in New York storage. N.Y. must distribute NOW!

Tweet: Never knew John Kerry had such a good sense of humor! Very impressed!

Tweet: Will be signing the CARE Act in the Oval Office today at 4:00 P.M. Eastern!

Tweet: News conference live from the @WhiteHouse today. 5:30 P.M. Eastern!

Tweet: I just signed the CARES Act the single biggest economic relief package in American History – twice as large as any relief bill ever enacted. At $2.2 Trillion Dollars this bill will deliver urgently-needed relief for our nation’s families workers and businesses. #CARESAct🇺🇸

Tweet: We are marshalling the full power of government and society to achieve victory over the virus. Together we will endure we will prevail and we will WIN! #CARESAct

Tweet: She is a third rate reporter who has nothing going. A Fake News “journalist”.

Tweet: I love Michigan one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor Gretchen “Half” Whitmer is way in over her ahead she doesn’t have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA

Tweet: I love Michigan one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor Gretchen “Half” Whitmer is way in over her head she doesn’t have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA

Tweet: Such Fake reporting by the @nytimes @washingtonpost @CNN &amp; others. They use a small portion of a sentence out of a full paragraph in order to demean. They really are corrupt and disgusting. No wonder the media is according to polls record setting low &amp; untrusted. #MAGA

Tweet: More Fake News!

Tweet: Thank you James!

Tweet: So much of the Lamestream Media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong. They are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist. These are very dangerous &amp; corrupt people who will do anything to win. NAME YOUR SOURCES!

Tweet: Highly recommended by Governor @MikeDeWine of Ohio. @FDA must move quickly!

Tweet: “With the Tax Cuts and new Trade Deals we were set for a tremendous growth rate this year.... and then the Virus came along.” @larry_kudlow @MariaBartiromo We were breaking all records especially on employment. It will all come roaring back again and fast!

Tweet: Hope the FDA can approve Mask Sterilization equipment ASAP. As per Governor @MikeDeWine there is a company in Ohio @Battelle which has equipment that can sterilize masks quickly.

Tweet: The Lamestream Media wants us to fail. That will NEVER happen!

Tweet: Polls are showing tremendous disapproval of Lamestream Media coverage of the Virus crisis. The Fake News just hasn’t figured that out yet!

Tweet: Because the “Ratings” of my News Conferences etc. are so high “Bachelor finale Monday Night Football type numbers” according to the @nytimes the Lamestream Media is going CRAZY. “Trump is reaching too many people we must stop him.” said one lunatic. See you at 5:00 P.M.!

Tweet: Happy National Vietnam War Veterans Day to all of our Vietnam era Veterans. You have earned our gratitude and thanks by your actions years ago and what you have done since returning home. The Nation thanks you and your families for your service and sacrifice. We love you!

Tweet: I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen &amp; the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan who left the Kingdom would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!

Tweet: Thank you very much to Ken Langone for being a great American and for your wonderful comments on @TeamCavuto.

Tweet: So proud of the @USACEHQ @FEMA and the Federal Government for the 2900 bed hospital they built in 4 days (way ahead of schedule) in the Javits Center for NY. We are now moving the teams to join others so they can continue to build more hospitals/beds. Keep up the GREAT WORK!

Tweet: Thank you Dr. Hahn &amp; the FDA for your fast approval of this respected Ohio company recommended by Governor @MikeDeWine. Great potential!

Tweet: Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats delayed the Workers Help/Stimulus Bill by over a week trying to add real “junk” into the Bill. Got some bad things having nothing to do with those affected by the Virus included. Republicans need their votes until we WIN BACK THE HOUSE IN 2020!

Tweet: On #NationalDoctorsDay we recognize the remarkable men &amp; women who treat their fellow Americans find cures for the diseases &amp; illnesses we face and never waver in their efforts to treat every patient with the dignity respect and empathy they deserve.

Tweet: “New York Governor Cuomo says President Trump has been “very helpful.” @foxandfriends Thank you everybody is working very hard!

Tweet: I watched a portion of low rated (very) Morning Psycho (Joe) this Morning in order to see what Nancy Pelosi had to say &amp; what moves she was planning to further hurt our Country. Actually other than her usual complaining that I’m a terrible person she wasn’t bad. Still praying!

Tweet: With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill. It should be VERY BIG &amp; BOLD Two Trillion Dollars and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4

Tweet: My Administration is helping U.S. auto workers by replacing the failed Obama Emissions Rule. Impossible to satisfy its Green New Deal Standard; Lots of unnecessary and expensive penalties to car buyers!

Tweet: My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3500 while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Positive impact on the environment! Foolish executives!

Tweet: Will be starting The White House news conference at 5:15 P.M. Eastern.

Tweet: Great work @AtlasAirWW thank you!

Tweet: 30 DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD#COVIDー19

Tweet: Congress must pass the old and very strongly proven deductibility by businesses on restaurants and entertainment. This will bring restaurants and everything related back - and stronger than ever. Move quickly they will all be saved!

Tweet: Upon information and belief Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on U.S. troops and/or assets in Iraq. If this happens Iran will pay a very heavy price indeed!

Tweet: “The States have to get the money to the people who need it.” @MariaBartiromo And FAST!

Tweet: Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia who spoke with President Putin of Russia &amp; I expect &amp; hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels and maybe substantially more which if it happens will be GREAT for the oil &amp; gas industry!

Tweet: 30 DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD

Tweet: We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks. “P Act” all the way. Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!

Tweet: Thank you Cory!

Tweet: I fully agree!

Tweet: I will immediately ask Congress for more money to support small businesses under the @ppploan if the allocated money runs out. So far way ahead of schedule. @BankofAmerica &amp; community banks are rocking! @SBAgov @USTreasury

Tweet: I will immediately ask Congress for more money to support small businesses under the #PPPloan if the allocated money runs out. So far way ahead of schedule. @BankofAmerica &amp; community banks are rocking! @SBAgov @USTreasury

Tweet: A very biased “journalist”.

Tweet: I agree!

Tweet: Thank you Gayle!

Tweet: We are learning much about the Invisible Enemy. It is tough and smart but we are tougher and smarter!

Tweet: White House news conference at 6:45 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!

Tweet: .@gayletrotter “To this day the establishment media have not admitted that they were wrong and the President was right.” @FoxNews

Tweet: For humanitarian reasons the passengers from the two CoronaVirus stricken cruise ships have been given medical treatment and when appropriate allowed to disembark under strict supervision. Very carefully done. People we’re dying &amp; no other countries would allow them to dock!

Tweet: Thank you Gayle. I only wish the public could fully understand how corrupt &amp; dishonest so much of our Lamestream Media is. My Press Conferences are vital. They are reaching millions of people that are not being told the truth &amp; haven’t been for years (Witch-Hunts Fake News)!

Tweet: USA STRONG!

Tweet: LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL!

Tweet: Advertising in the Failing New York Times is WAY down. Washington Post is not much better. I can’t say whether this is because they are Fake News sources of information to a level that few can understand or the Virus is just plain beating them up. Fake News is bad for America!

Tweet: Joe Biden wanted the date for the Democrat National Convention moved to a later time period. Now he wants a “Virtual” Convention one where he doesn’t have to show up. Gee I wonder why? Also what ever happened to that phone call he told the Fake News he wanted to make to me?

Tweet: Congratulations to State Representative Karen Whitsett of Michigan. So glad you are getting better!

Tweet: White House news conference at 5:45 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!

Tweet: The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that tomorrow’s election will proceed as scheduled. VOTE for Justice Daniel Kelly tomorrow and be safe!

Tweet: Great job being done by Dr. Nicole Saphier on @FoxNews!

Tweet: Vote today Tuesday for highly respected Republican Justice Daniel Kelly. Tough on Crime loves your Military Vets Farmers &amp; will save your 2nd Amendment. A BIG VOTE!

Tweet: The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason funded largely by the United States yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?

Tweet: Why didn’t the I.G. who spent 8 years with the Obama Administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu debacle where 17000 people died?) want to talk to the Admirals Generals V.P. &amp; others in charge before doing her report. Another Fake Dossier!

Tweet: Wisconsin get out and vote NOW for Justice Daniel Kelly. Protect your 2nd Amendment!

Tweet: Just had a conf call w/ major lenders discussing our Great Small Businesses &amp; the #PPPloan. I ask every company big &amp; small making announcements about innovative contributions hiring new workers or looking to overcome setbacks to share your stories with #AmericaWorksTogether!

Tweet: “The number of New Yorkers admitted to hospitals has dropped.” @ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends Good news!

Tweet: Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud and for whatever reason doesn’t work out well for Republicans. @foxandfriends

Tweet: Will be immediately sending 100 Ventilators to Colorado at the request of Senator Gardner!

Tweet: Once we OPEN UP OUR GREAT COUNYRY and it will be sooner rather than later the horror of the Invisible Enemy except for those that sadly lost a family member or friend must be quickly forgotten. Our Economy will BOOM perhaps like never before!!!

Tweet: FLATTENING OF THE CURVE!

Tweet: Bernie Sanders is OUT! Thank you to Elizabeth Warren. If not for her Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday! This ended just like the Democrats &amp; the DNC wanted same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party TRADE!

Tweet: Wow Bernie is unwilling to give up his delegates and wants more of them! What’s that all about?

Tweet: Can’t see AOC plus 3 supporting Sleepy Joe!

Tweet: This morning 450000 protective suits landed in Dallas Texas. This was made possible because of the partnership of two great American companies—DuPont and FedEx—and our friends in Vietnam. Thank you! @DuPont_News @FedEx

Tweet: Absentee Ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens military and others who can’t get to the polls on Election Day. These ballots are very different from 100% Mail-In Voting which is “RIPE for FRAUD” and shouldn’t be allowed!

Tweet: .@OANN A key CoronaVirus Model is now predicting far fewer deaths than the number shown in earlier models. That’s because the American people are doing a great job. Social Distancing etc. Keep going!

Tweet: On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day we honor the more than 500000 American warriors captured while protecting our way of life. We pay tribute to these Patriots for their unwavering and unrelenting spirit!

Tweet: Great News: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has just been moved out of Intensive Care. Get well Boris!!!

Tweet: The Wall Street Journal always “forgets” to mention that the ratings for the White House Press Briefings are “through the roof” (Monday Night Football Bachelor Finale according to @nytimes) &amp; is only way for me to escape the Fake News &amp; get my views across. WSJ is Fake News!

Tweet: Thank you Erin!

Tweet: Thank you Frank. It’s ABC Fake News. They knew they were wrong when they went with this Hoax of a story!

Tweet: Tim Scott is Great!

Tweet: Democrats are blocking a 251 Million Dollar funding boost for Small Businesses which will help them keep their employees. It should be for only that reason with no additions. We should have a big Infrastructure Phase Four with Payroll Tax Cuts &amp; more. Big Economic Bounceback!

Tweet: This week in only 4 days we had the biggest Stock Market increase since 1974. We have a great chance for the really big bounce when the Invisible Enemy is gone!

Tweet: Democrats are blocking a 251 Billion Dollar funding boost for Small Businesses which will help them keep their employees. It should be for only that reason with no additions. We should have a big Infrastructure Phase Four with Payroll Tax Cuts &amp; more. Big Economic Bounceback!

Tweet: Not good Gregg but it is what it is. Have to save the airlines!

Tweet: Wow Approval Rating in the Republican Party - 96%. Thank you!

Tweet: HAPPY GOOD FRIDAY TO ALL!

Tweet: The White House Press Conference will take place today at 1:00 P.M. recognizing that it is Good Friday!

Tweet: Because the T.V. Ratings for the White House News Conference’s are the highest the Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats &amp; of course the few remaining RINO’S are doing everything in their power to disparage &amp; end them. The People’s Voice!

Tweet: The Invisible Enemy will soon be in full retreat!

Tweet: Nobody wants to say that if Elizabeth Warren gets out of the race before Super Tuesday Crazy Bernie Sanders wins virtually every state in a blowout...NOT EVEN CLOSE! I haven’t heard one member of the Fake News Establishment even mention this irrefutable fact. FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: “Trump did a deal with Japan. A lot of our product goes to Japan and we are booming in North Dakota.” Jim on C Span Washington Journal. Our Trade Deals will be having a big impact on our Country as they kick in!

Tweet: WE WILL BUILD IT AGAIN!

Tweet: Wishing all a safe and blessed Easter Sunday. I will be tuning into Pastor @robertjeffress at Church in Dallas Texas tomorrow morning at 10:20 AM Eastern.

Tweet: Great editorial by @SenRonJohnson!

Tweet: “The President and the Federal Government are doing an excellent job. When they say the death toll isn’t going to be as high as reported they (the opposition) act like they’re sad because it’s lower. I think they are (Press Conferences) wonderful.” West Virginia Resident C Span

Tweet: Watching @FoxNews on weekend afternoons is a total waste of time. We now have some great alternatives like @OANN.

Tweet: So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs and obviously want back in. Sad!

Tweet: So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe NOT China. This is a first! I wonder where the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs and obviously want back in. Sad!

Tweet: The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board doesn’t have a clue on how to fight and win. Their views on Tariffs &amp; Trade are losers for the U.S. but winners for other countries including China. If we followed their standards we’d have no Country left. They should love Sleepy Joe!

Tweet: I will be watching. HAVE A GREAT EASTER!

Tweet: Governor @GavinNewsom of California has been very nice &amp; highly supportive about the great job we have done working together for California. That is the good news but this is the bad. He is unfairly under attack by the Radical Left Dems MSDNC etc. He is strong! Will he fold?

Tweet: So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs and obviously want back in. Sad!

Tweet: Will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews!

Tweet: Mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!

Tweet: Cryin’Chuck doesn’t have a clue. Couldn’t care less about the American Worker!

Tweet: Will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews!

Tweet: HAPPY EASTER!

Tweet: A very good sign is that empty hospital beds are becoming more and more prevalent. We deployed 418 Doctors Nurses and Respiratory Therapists from the hospital ship Comfort and the Javits Convention Center to hospitals in NYC &amp; State. Have more bed capacity than was needed. Good!

Tweet: HAPPY EASTER!

Tweet: Great businessman &amp; philanthropist Bernies Marcus Co-Founder of Home Depot said that Congress was too distracted by the (phony) Impeachment Witch Hunt when they should have been investigating CoronaVirus when it first appeared in China. Media played a big roll also!@dcexaminer

Tweet: For the first time in history there is a fully signed Presidential Disaster Declaration for all 50 States. We are winning and will win the war on the Invisible Enemy!

Tweet: The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done. This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States. I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. I just spoke to them from the Oval Office. Great deal for all!

Tweet: Just watched Mike Wallace wannabe Chris Wallace on @FoxNews. I am now convinced that he is even worse than Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Press(please!) or the people over at Deface the Nation. What the hell is happening to @FoxNews. It’s a whole new ballgame over there!

Tweet: If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing with all their might the fact that President Trump “ignored early warnings about the threat” then why did Media &amp; Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China? They said “early &amp; not necessary.” Corrupt Media!

Tweet: The Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) and their partner the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats have put their political game plan in full swing. “Whether he is right or wrong it doesn’t matter. Criticize ’Trump’ for everything and don’t let the public see Biden. Hide him.”

Tweet: Governors get your states testing programs &amp; apparatus perfected. Be ready big things are happening. No excuses! The Federal Government is there to help. We are testing more than any country in the World. Also gear up with Face Masks!

Tweet: Fake News!

Tweet: Sorry Fake News it’s all on tape. I banned China long before people spoke up. Thank you @OANN

Tweet: Great going Natalie!

Tweet: I look forward to it also!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: Thank you Paris!

Tweet: The @nytimes story is a Fake just like the “paper” itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later and @PeterNavarroUSA memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News!

Tweet: I am working hard to expose the corruption and dishonesty in the Lamestream Media. That part is easy the hard part is WHY?

Tweet: The @nytimes story is a Fake just like the “paper” itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News!

Tweet: White House news conference today at 5:00 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!

Tweet: First the Fake News Media said that it’s not fair for the President of the United States to be giving news conferences but it is the only way I can reach the American People as seen in the below poll.

Tweet: My deepest sympathies go out to Frieda Chera and the family of the late great Stanley Chera one of Manhattan’s most brilliant real estate minds. Stanley was charitable kind and a wonderful friend. He will be truly missed!

Tweet: The Democrats don’t want to approve more money for our great workers under the incredibly successful “Paycheck” plan. Replenish Account Now!

Tweet: Cuomo’s been calling daily even hourly begging for everything most of which should have been the state’s responsibility such as new hospitals beds ventilators etc. I got it all done for him and everyone else and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!

Tweet: GET RID OF BALLOT HARVESTING IT IS RAMPANT WITH FRAUD. THE USA MUST HAVE VOTER I.D. THE ONLY WAY TO GET AN HONEST COUNT!

Tweet: Tell the Democrat Governors that “Mutiny On The Bounty” was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy!

Tweet: My Administration is committed to protecting the Homeland from the scourge of narco-terrorists and traffickers seeking to destabilize the United States and our Hemisphere. Our military deployments in the Caribbean &amp; Eastern Pacific will endure until these threats are neutralized!

Tweet: White House news conference today at 5:45 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!

Tweet: White House news conference today at 5:30 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!

Tweet: .@OANN Poll “Gives President Trump a 52% Approval Rating in North Carolina and a seven point lead over (Sleepy) Joe Biden. The President also helps other Republican Candidates including @SenThomTillis who has a 4% lead over his Democrat rival.”

Tweet: Crazy “Nancy Pelosi you are a weak person. You are a poor leader. You are the reason America hates career politicians like yourself.” @seanhannity She is totally incompetent &amp; controlled by the Radical Left a weak and pathetic puppet. Come back to Washington and do your job!

Tweet: Democrats are blocking additional funding for the popular Paycheck Protection Program. They are killing American small businesses. Stop playing politics Dems! Support Refilling PPP NOW – it is out of funds!

Tweet: Major News Conference tonight the White House at 6:00 P.M. (Eastern) to explain Guidelines for OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN!

Tweet: Crazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account. She wanted everyone to pack into Chinatown long after I closed the BORDER TO CHINA. Based on her statement she is responsible for many deaths. She’s an incompetent third-rate politician!

Tweet: THANK GOD FOR TRUCKERS!

Tweet: Today people started losing their jobs because of Crazy Nancy Pelosi Cryin’ Chuck Schumer and the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats who should immediately come back to Washington and approve legislation to help families in America. End your ENDLESS VACATION!

Tweet: LIBERATE MINNESOTA!

Tweet: LIBERATE MICHIGAN!

Tweet: LIBERATE VIRGINIA and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!

Tweet: Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! Also don’t forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!

Tweet: China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S. not even close!

Tweet: The States have to step up their TESTING!

Tweet: Cuomo ridiculously wanted “40 thousand Ventilators”. We gave him a small fraction of that number and it was plenty. State should have had them in stockpile!

Tweet: White House news conference today at 6:00 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!

Tweet: They are Fake News Losers!

Tweet: Great book. Get it and support Charlie!

Tweet: Cut him off now!

Tweet: Lamestream Media is only getting worse!

Tweet: An incompetent political hack! Come back to Washington &amp; take care of our great American workers.

Tweet: Spending the morning speaking to @fema and Military relative to CoronaVirus. Also spoke to leaders of various countries including Poland South Korea and Bahrain. Last night had a very gold conversation with the President of Mexico on numerous topics. Border is very strong!

Tweet: John James will be a GREAT Senator for Michigan!

Tweet: Really nice to see this and what a great pick!

Tweet: I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:00 P.M. Thank you!

Tweet: Thank you @Honeywell great job!

Tweet: Great news thank you!

Tweet: The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media by far is “sources say” or “officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity” or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn’t even exist. The American people should demand NAMES!

Tweet: I gave up on Drudge (a really nice guy) long ago as have many others. People are dropping off like flies!

Tweet: China wants Sleepy Joe sooo badly. They want all of those billions of dollars that they have been paying to the U.S. back and much more. Joe is an easy mark their DREAM CANDIDATE!

Tweet: Will be online tomorrow morning at 10:30am (Eastern) watching @jackngraham from @Prestonwood Baptist in Dallas Texas. You can join us at

Tweet: CONGRATULATIONS @AF_Academy!

Tweet: Look forward to this!

Tweet: Great credit must be given to @FEMA and all of those that are helping our States make it big!

Tweet: Just like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the “King of Ventilators” other countries are calling asking for help-we will!) I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY!

Tweet: Nervous Nancy is an inherently “dumb” person. She wasted all of her time on the Impeachment Hoax. She will be overthrown either by inside or out just like her last time as “Speaker”. Wallace &amp; @FoxNews are on a bad path watch!

Tweet: .@FoxNews “Dems say President Trump is trying to open the United States Economy too quickly” but if I took even a little more time they would loudly chant that I am moving too slowly. Just political talking points for them. For me it’s about lives &amp; the future of our Country!

Tweet: Great book by @SenatorTimScott!

Tweet: “On February 19th there was a Democratic Debate in Las Vegas. Three words weren’t said: Virus CoronaVirus or COVID19. NEVER came up!” @BretBaier

Tweet: Great Alan. They are Fake News!

Tweet: Watched the first 5 minutes of poorly rated Morning Psycho on MSDNC just to see if he is as “nuts” as people are saying. He’s worse. Such hatred and contempt! I used to do his show all the time before the 2016 election then cut him off. Wasn’t worth the effort his mind is shot!

Tweet: It is amazing that I became President of the United States with such a totally corrupt and dishonest Lamestream Media going after me all day and all night. Either I’m really good far better than the Fake News wants to admit or they don’t have nearly the power as once thought!

Tweet: I’ve had great “ratings” my whole life there’s nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are “through the roof”(Monday Night Football Bachelor Finale @nytimes) but I don’t care about that. I care about going around the Fake News to the PEOPLE!

Tweet: 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! This must also mean that most importantly we are doing a good (great) job in the handling of the Pandemic.

Tweet: We will never let the great U.S. Oil &amp; Gas Industry down. I have instructed the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of the Treasury to formulate a plan which will make funds available so that these very important companies and jobs will be secured long into the future!

Tweet: I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!

Tweet: “Economic impact of Covid-19.” @foxandfriends Very interesting analysis. Light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you!

Tweet: I will be signing my Executive Order prohibiting immigration into our Country today. In the meantime even without this order our Southern Border aided substantially by the 170 miles of new Border Wall &amp; 27000 Mexican soldiers is very tight - including for human trafficking!

Tweet: Happy Birthday to the great Cindy Adams of the New York Post. Cindy is 90 but looks 39 to me. She is going strong!

Tweet: Important news!

Tweet: Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators building hospitals beds and yes Testing have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up!

Tweet: The Fake and totally corrupt News is after her as a means of getting to me. She’s smart and strong knows the truth. Already a heroine to many!

Tweet: Our Country wants to move safely forward. There is a tremendous pent up demand. We will open big!

Tweet: Great conversation with President Lenin Moreno of the Republic if Equador. We will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators of which we have recently manufactured many and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus!

Tweet: Just spoke to my friend President Joko Widodo of the Republic of Indonesia. Asking for Ventilators which we will provide. Great cooperation between us!

Tweet: Just spoke to President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador. Will be helping them with Ventilators which are desperately needed. They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border!

Tweet: I (or @VP) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS! Spas beauty salons tattoo parlors &amp; barber shops should take a little slower path but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (&amp; USA)!

Tweet: Great News! Randall Stephenson the CEO of heavily indebted AT&amp;T which owns and presides over Fake News @CNN is leaving or was forced out. Anyone who lets a garbage “network” do and say the things that CNN does should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better!

Tweet: Many testing sites are and have been open &amp; available. Just passed 5 Million Tests far more than any other country in the world. In fact more than all other major countries combined! Don’t believe the Fake News!

Tweet: Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will!

Tweet: It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. Every person needing a Ventilator got one!

Tweet: We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World and even more than all major countries combined!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a “Hoax” I said that the Democrats and the way they lied about it are a Hoax. Also it did start with “one person from China” and then grew &amp; will be a “Miracle” end!

Tweet: If the Wall Street Journal “Editorial” writers had called as they should have they would have easily found that I was “NOT happy with the Georgia Governor on Tuesday night.” You said the opposite and got it wrong as you often do!

Tweet: Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking &amp; asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong I was speaking to our Laboratory expert not Deborah about sunlight etc. &amp; the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt &amp; sick!

Tweet: What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions &amp; then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings &amp; the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time &amp; effort!

Tweet: Remember the Cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. Be careful be safe use common sense!

Tweet: I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats together with their Mainstream Media partners are the Hoax. They have been called out &amp; embarrassed on this even admitting they were wrong but continue to spread the lie!

Tweet: Had a great call with Catholic Leaders and Educators earlier today. I will be online tomorrow at 10:15 A.M. (Eastern) for Sunday Mass celebrated by @CardinalDolan at St. Patrick’s Cathedral (@StPatsNYC) in New York City. Join me:

Tweet: Happy Birthday to Melania our great First Lady!

Tweet: .@CardinalDolan Thank you for a great call yesterday with Catholic Leaders and a great Service today from @stpatrickscath!

Tweet: .@CardinalDolan Thank you for a great call yesterday with Catholic Leaders and a great Service today from @StPatsNYC!

Tweet: The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am the hardest working President in history. I don’t know about that but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history. The Fake News hates it!

Tweet: Reports that H.H.S. Secretary @AlexAzar is going to be “fired” by me are Fake News. The Lamestream Media knows this but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos &amp; havoc in the minds of the public. They never even called to ask. Alex is doing an excellent job!

Tweet: Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as “having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.” Does sarcasm ever work?

Tweet: Laura just another Fake News Report!

Tweet: They asked me to be at West Point on June 13th. &amp; I will be there!

Tweet: They are one of the worst in the “news” business. Total slime balls!

Tweet: Great!

Tweet: American citizens! We were long ahead of Dems who were all against the BAN.

Tweet: So true!

Tweet: Blame the Democrats for any “lateness” in your Enhanced Unemployment Insurance. I wanted the money to be paid directly they insisted it be paid by states for distribution. I told them this would happen especially with many states which have old computers.

Tweet: There has never been in the history of our Country a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now even in the midst of a National Emergency the Invisible Enemy!

Tweet: FAKE NEWS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!

Tweet: Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois as example) and cities in all cases Democrat run and managed when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? I am open to discussing anything but just asking?

Tweet: I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!

Tweet: Because Shifty is a crooked politician!

Tweet: We are doing far more and better Testing than any other country in the world and yet the media does nothing but complain. No matter how good a job is done the same as with the Ventilators they will never say we are doing a great job they will only viciously gripe!

Tweet: Many States moving to SAFELY &amp; QUICKLY reopen!

Tweet: Texas to open businesses in phases beginning Friday. Great job being done by @GregAbbott_TX

Tweet: But I love Diamond &amp; Silk and so do millions of people!

Tweet: Thank you @BlueAngels and @AFThunderbirds! #AmericaStrong

Tweet: THANK YOU MICHAEL! @bittyandbeaus

Tweet: The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World. Other countries are way behind us in Testing and therefore show far fewer cases!

Tweet: At least they admit it. The Failing @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost never correct their Fake Reporting!

Tweet: THANK YOU @MarkLevinShow!

Tweet: No I think Amash would make a wonderful candidate especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his Congressional seat. He almost always votes for the Do Nothing Dems anyway. I like him even more than Jill Stein!

Tweet: Happy Birthday to three time Olympian and five term Congressman @JimRyun!

Tweet: .@CNN doesn’t want to speak about their persecution of General Michael Flynn &amp; why they got the story so wrong. They along with others should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man &amp; his family. They won’t even cover the big breaking news about this scam!

Tweet: Just told that Fake News @CNN is falsely reporting that I was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense. Actually he is doing a great job I never shouted at him (been with me for years including the 2016 win) &amp; have no intention to do so. Just FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC a Concast Scam Company wouldn’t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. He’s a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!

Tweet: I must admit that Lyin’ Brian Williams is while dumber than hell quite a bit smarter than Fake News @CNN “anchorman” Don Lemon the “dumbest man on television”. Then you have Psycho Joe “What Ever Happened To Your Girlfriend?” Scarborough another of the low I.Q. individuals!

Tweet: Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC!

Tweet: Despite reports to the contrary Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. As of today 2462 people have died there a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207) Finland (206) or Denmark (443). The United States made the correct decision!

Tweet: Does anybody really believe that Roger Stone a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting FBI Agents (with Fake News @CNN closely in toe) was treated fairly. How about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred &amp; bias. Same scammers as General Flynn!

Tweet: What happened to General Michael Flynn a war hero should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!

Tweet: FAKE POLLING just like 2016 (but worse)!

Tweet: Really? Have you looked at the numbers lately!

Tweet: Plus many!

Tweet: DIRTY COP JAMES COMEY GOT CAUGHT!

Tweet: Great!

Tweet: FAKE NEWS!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats!

Tweet: We can’t let the Fake News and their partner the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats get away with stealing the Election. They tried that in 2016. How did that work out?

Tweet: Over 120 MILLION Economic Impact Payments have already gone out to hardworking Americans! If you haven’t yet received your payment go to and click on “GET MY PAYMENT” to receive your money FAST!

Tweet: Vote @MikeGarcia2020 by May 12th! His opponent @ChristyforCA25 voted to fire teachers and cut their salaries while bumping up her pay. Now she’s mocking our Great Vets! We need Navy Fighter Pilot Mike Garcia in #CA25!

Tweet: “The only thing we got wrong is that it was even worse (the corruption) than we thought.” @Jim_Jordan DIRTY COPS!

Tweet: I have done more for farmers and ranchers than any President in history and it has been my honor in doing so!

Tweet: Dirty Cop!

Tweet: Cryin’ Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over &amp; over again. “We don’t have enough testing ” he would repeat when he knows we have done a great job on Testing just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied gave NY SALT. Run AOC!

Tweet: Cryin Chuck Schumer compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states has brought very little back to N.Y. A totally overrated loser the one thing he has given them is SALT. He never even called me to stop it. No wonder Cuomo &amp; most others can’t stand him. AOC!

Tweet: The Governor of Michigan should give a little and put out the fire. These are very good people but they are angry. They want their lives back again safely! See them talk to them make a deal.

Tweet: Concast (@NBCNews) and Fake News @CNN are going out of their way to say GREAT things about China. They are Chinese puppets who want to do business there. They use USA airwaves to help China. The Enemy of the People!

Tweet: Don’t allow RIGGED ELECTIONS!

Tweet: There is tremendous CoronaVirus testing capacity in Washington for the Senators returning to Capital Hill on Monday. Likewise the House which should return but isn’t because of Crazy Nancy P. The 5 minute Abbott Test will be used. Please inform Dr. Brian P. Monahan. @MarkMeadows

Tweet: 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! Also just out highest ever Approval Rating overall in the new Gallup Poll and shows “Trump beating Sleepy Joe Biden.”

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: The Russia Hoax is the biggest political scandal in American history. Treason!!! Lets see how it ends????

Tweet: Thank you Michael. You also!

Tweet: That’s right Jack. Keep up the good work!

Tweet: I hate to be promoting AT&amp;T but @OANN is Great News not Fake News. Everybody should be carrying them!

Tweet: The Impeachment Hoax will be exposed. Crazy Nancy gets Nothing Done that’s why she got thrown out as Speaker the first time. Also she should come back to Washington now!

Tweet: Border Wall is going up FAST. Over 172 miles already built. 450 miles by early next year or sooner! Dems want OPEN BORDERS. I want STRONG BORDERS!

Tweet: I for one am glad to see he is back and well!

Tweet: Very cool. Please thank him!

Tweet: She was thrown off The View like a dog Zero T.V. Personas. Now Wallace is a 3rd rate lapdog for Fake News MSDNC (Concast). Doesn’t have what it takes!

Tweet: So true although Honest Abe wasn’t bad. Thank you!

Tweet: Not much time to sleep. Thank you!

Tweet: The Democrats are just as always looking for trouble. They do nothing constructive even in times of crisis. They don’t want to blame their cash cow China for the plague. China is blaming Europe. Dr. Fauci will be testifying before the Senate very soon! #DONOTHINGDEMOCRATS

Tweet: No reason to turn it down except politics. We have plenty of testing. Maybe you need a new Doctor over there. Crazy Nancy will use it as an excuse not to show up to work!

Tweet: Beautiful thank you to our GREAT @BlueAngels and @AFThunderbirds!

Tweet: .@PeteHegseth “Oh bye the way I appreciate the message from former President Bush but where was he during Impeachment calling for putting partisanship aside.” @foxandfriends He was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history!

Tweet: The Fake News doesn’t show real polls. Lamestream Media is totally CORRUPT the Enemy of the People!

Tweet: Many complaints coming in about Maine. I love that State won Maine 2 - Don’t make the cure worse than the problem itself. That can happen you know!

Tweet: Hopefully our Country will soon mend. We are all missing our wonderful rallies and many other things!

Tweet: Wow!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: Keep punching Mike!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: Progress being made!

Tweet: Some things never get old!

Tweet: Going well despite the Fake News!

Tweet: So nice to see this great honor. Thank you (but haven’t played golf in a long time)!

Tweet: Thank you very much to our beautiful “boaters.” I will never let you down!

Tweet: Thank you Ryan. Working hard!

Tweet: I’m with the TRUCKERS all the way. Thanks for the meeting at the White House with my representatives from the Administration. It is all going to work out well!

Tweet: “Concast” should open up a long overdue Florida Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough. I know him and Crazy Mika well used them beautifully in the last Election dumped them nicely and will state on the record that he is “nuts”. Besides bad ratings! #OPENJOECOLDCASE

Tweet: Getting great reviews finally for how well we are handling the pandemic especially our strong production of desperately needed ventilators the building of field hospitals &amp; beds and soon the great things we are doing on testing. People are really working well together!

Tweet: And I’m Endorsing you also Lacy you truly deserve it. You are doing a great job and Omar is a disaster who wants much higher taxes hates our Military &amp; our Vets demands Open Borders and is fighting to take away our great 2nd Amendment. Good luck Lacy!

Tweet: Republicans love the biggest Tax Cuts Rebuilt Military Choice for Vets saving 2nd Amendment and many other things my Administration has done but what they love beyond all else is 252 (so far!) Federal Judges not including two great Supreme Court Justices. A Big Record!

Tweet: Mexico is sadly experiencing very big CoronaVirus problems and now California get this doesn’t want people coming over the Southern Border. A Classic! They are sooo lucky that I am their President. Border is very tight and the Wall is rapidly being built!

Tweet: Interesting? By Congress not wanting the special 5 minute testing apparatus they are saying that they are not “essential”. In any event we have great testing capacity and have performed 6.5 million tests which is more than every country in the world combined!

Tweet: A great new book “Fortitude: American Resilience in the Era of Outrage” by former Navy Seal and current Texas Congressman @DanCrenshawTX is now available. A fantastic guy — get your copy today!

Tweet: MSDNC and FAKE NEWS CNN are going wild trying to protect China!

Tweet: THANK YOU #USNSComfort!

Tweet: Exciting to see our Country starting to open up again!

Tweet: Oil prices moving up nicely as demand begins again!

Tweet: Heading to Arizona!

Tweet: Governors should let roads and highway construction begin before heavy traffic starts which will be soon. Some Governors never stopped which proved to be very smart. They built and fixed roads during long no traffic periods. Also saved big dollars!

Tweet: For the constant criticism from the Do Nothing Democrats and their Fake News partners here is the newest chart on our great testing “miracle" compared to other countries. Dems and LameStream Media should be proud of the USA instead of always ripping us down!

Tweet: The Do Nothing Democrats and their leader the Fake News Lamestream Media are doing everything possible to hurt and disparage our Country. No matter what we do or say no matter how big a win they report that it was a loss or not good enough. The Enemy of the People!

Tweet: Remember this? Happy #CincoDeMayo!

Tweet: Most of the money raised by the RINO losers of the so-called “Lincoln Project” goes into their own pockets. With what I’ve done on Judges Taxes Regulations Healthcare the Military Vets (Choice!) &amp; protecting our great 2A they should love Trump. Problem is I BEAT THEM ALL!

Tweet: Well run States should not be bailing out poorly run States using CoronaVirus as the excuse! The elimination of Sanctuary Cities Payroll Taxes and perhaps Capital Gains Taxes must be put on the table. Also lawsuit indemnification &amp; business deductions for restaurants &amp; ent.

Tweet: Wow! Congratulations to Greg Gutfeld a one time Trump Hater who has come all the way home. His Ratings easily beat no talent Stephen Colbert nice guy Jimmy Fallon and wacko “last placer” Jimmy Kimmel. Greg built his show from scratch and did a great job in doing so. @FoxNews

Tweet: DRAIN THE SWAMP!

Tweet: Vote @MikeGarcia2020 by May 12th! His opponent @ChristyforCA25 voted to fire teachers and cut their salaries while bumping up her pay. Now she’s mocking our Great Vets! We need Navy Fighter Pilot Mike Garcia in #CA25!

Tweet: So in California the Democrats who fought like crazy to get all mail in only ballots and succeeded have just opened a voting booth in the most Democrat area in the State. They are trying to steal another election. It’s all rigged out there. These votes must not count. SCAM!

Tweet: Mike has my complete &amp; total endorsement. We need him badly in Washington. A great fighter pilot &amp; hero &amp; a brilliant Annapolis grad Mike will never let you down. Mail in ballots &amp; check that they are counted!

Tweet: TRANSITION TO GREATNESS!

Tweet: CA25 is a Rigged Election. Trying to steal it from @MikeGarcia2020. @GavinNewsom must act now!

Tweet: Governor @GavinNewsom of California won’t let restaurants beaches and stores open but he installs a voting both system in a highly Democrat area (supposed to be mail in ballots only) because our great candidate @MikeGarcia2020 is winning by a lot. CA25 Rigged Election!

Tweet: Why is it that all of the political pundits &amp; consultants that I beat so easily &amp; badly people that charged their clients far more than their services were worth have become so totally “unhinged” when it come to your favorite President me. These people are stone cold crazy!

Tweet: Starting early next week at my order the USA will be purchasing from our Farmers Ranchers &amp; Specialty Crop Growers 3 Billion Dollars worth of Dairy Meat &amp; Produce for Food Lines &amp; Kitchens. “FARMERS TO FAMILY FOOD BOX” Great news for all! @SecretarySonny @ZippyDuvall

Tweet: Governor @GavinNewsom of California won’t let restaurants beaches and stores open but he installs a voting booth system in a highly Democrat area (supposed to be mail in ballots only) because our great candidate @MikeGarcia2020 is winning by a lot. CA25 Rigged Election!

Tweet: So great to see our Country starting to open up again!

Tweet: A great man for Washington! Will Drain the Swamp!

Tweet: When are the Fake Journalists who received unwarranted Pulitzer Prizes for Russia Russia Russia and the Impeachment Scam going to turn in their tarnished awards so they can be given to the real journalists who got it right. I’ll give you the names there are plenty of them!

Tweet: We are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic especially the very early BAN of people from China the infectious source entering the USA. Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks bad polls - didn’t have a clue!

Tweet: Thank you Mike!

Tweet: True!

Tweet: Congratulations to Officer John Catanzara for being elected President of the Chicago Police Union. He always “Gets the Job Done”. #MAGA @foxandfriends

Tweet: OBAMAGATE!

Tweet: This book is a MUST BUY!

Tweet: .@CBS and their show @60Minutes are doing everything within their power which is far less today than it was in the past to defend China and the horrible Virus pandemic that was inflicted on the USA and the rest of the World. I guess they want to do business in China!

Tweet: Thank you!

Tweet: He got caught OBAMAGATE!

Tweet: Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd should be FIRED by “Concast” (NBC) for this fraud. He knew exactly what he was doing. Public Airwaves = Fake News! @AjitPaiFCC @FCC

Tweet: OBAMAGATE!

Tweet: This is why it’s not really the Lamestream Media it’s the Rigged Media....and it is what I’m up against. It was corrupt in 2016. Now it is much more corrupt and what you are seeing is the least of it....but WE WILL WIN AGAIN!

Tweet: @FCC THIS IS A DISGRACE EVEN WORSE THAN @NBC USUALLY IS WHICH IS REALLY BAD. SLEEPY EYES MUST BE FIRED!

Tweet: Great credit being given for our Coronavirus response except in the Fake News. They are a disgrace to America!

Tweet: Dems are trying to steal the Mike Garcia Congressional Race in California. Republicans get out and VOTE for your terrific candidate ASAP!

Tweet: Coronavirus numbers are looking MUCH better going down almost everywhere. Big progress being made!

Tweet: OBAMAGATE makes Watergate look small time!

Tweet: The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now and they are fully aware of what that entails. The Democrats are moving slowly all over the USA for political purposes. They would wait until November 3rd if it were up to them. Don’t play politics. Be safe move quickly!

Tweet: .@WashTimes “FBI Went Rogue In Pursuit Of Trump”

Tweet: He should be FIRED by Concast. If done by a Republican would be “prosecuted”. @AjitPaiFCC

Tweet: Because it was OBAMAGATE and he and Sleepy Joe led the charge. The most corrupt administration in U.S. history!

Tweet: THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. Sadly our Lamestream Media is TOTALLY CORRUPT!

Tweet: Congressman @DonJBacon is doing a tremendous job for Nebraska! He served our Country as an Air Force General and now he serves our Vets Farmers and Small Businesses. Strongly supports the Second Amendment. Don has my Complete &amp; Total Endorsement! #NE02

Tweet: Congressman Jeff Fortenberry (@SupportFortNE) is a great advocate for Nebraska. He fights for Farmers Small Businesses and our incredible Vets and Military. Jeff has my Complete and Total Endorsement! #NE01

Tweet: OBAMAGATE!

Tweet: Interestingly!

Tweet: The Lamestream Media is truly out of control. Look how they work (conspire!) together. They are the Enemy of the People but don’t worry we will WIN in November!

Tweet: ColdCaseJoe!

Tweet: Then we must be very careful. Crazy Nancy would be a total disaster and the USA will never be a Communist Country!

Tweet: A great time to have strong Borders and we now have the strongest Borders in our history. 182 miles of Border Wall already built! Dems want Open Borders let EVERYONE IN. No thanks!

Tweet: Fake Journalists!

Tweet: Big news!

Tweet: Sleepy Eyes fails again!

Tweet: OBAMAGATE makes Watergate look small time!

Tweet: Ratings way down show sucks!

Tweet: Remember get out and Vote for Mike Garcia in CA25. A really big deal for our Country!

Tweet: More than all other countries together!

Tweet: Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all. I don’t blame them!

Tweet: So interesting to see all of these people I beat so badly pundits &amp; consultants that never had a chance telling me how to run for office. Many are Republicans who should LOVE our 280 new Judges rebuilt Military 2A great V.A. Low Taxes etc. Just don’t like that I beat them!

Tweet: Remember this every Governor who has sky high approval on their handling of the Coronavirus and I am happy for them all could in no way have gotten those numbers or had that success without me and the Federal Governments help. From Ventilators to Testing we made it happen!

Tweet: Looking forward to being in Allentown Pennsylvania on Thursday. I love the State and for very good reason!

Tweet: Wisconsin please get out NOW and vote for Tom Tiffany for Congress. A great guy!

Tweet: Crude Oil prices going up as Saudi Arabia cuts production levels. Our great Energy Companies with millions of JOBS are starting to look very good again. At the same time gasoline prices at record lows (like a big Tax Cut). The BEST of all Worlds. “Transition To Greatness”

Tweet: California should let Tesla &amp; @elonmusk open the plant NOW. It can be done Fast &amp; Safely!

Tweet: As long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates the USA should also accept the “GIFT”. Big numbers!

Tweet: Shifty Schiff exposed!
